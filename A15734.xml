            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:21007:3"/> For that he endevoured by them to change our faith, into the faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arminius.</hi> Which deed I could not but deteſt: becauſe <hi>that</hi> faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> is falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous: And vpon that deteſtation, I became an humble ſuter vnto the Lord God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue our faith in the puritie thereof, ſeing he is the Author of truth, and <hi>his eye-lids preſerue pure knowledge.</hi> Now, out of the ſame affection, I proſtrate my ſelfe &amp; this Cauſe, before your reverend, honourable, and graue Iudgements, and high authoritie: with all ſubmiſſion, and fervent deſire; Craving</p>
            <p>That you will 1. take this Cauſe into your conſideration.</p>
            <p>2. Preſerue the faith of our Church in the puritie it hath had hitherto.</p>
            <p>3. Endevour to prevent the corrupting of it in time to come.</p>
            <p>I doe moſt willingly confeſſe, that I may ſeeme to ſome, to deſerue blame, in that I doe thus preſume, to offer my ſelfe, into your moſt honourable preſence, and Tribunall. Yea, I am ready to giue that judgement againſt my ſelfe, when I conſider the meanneſſe of my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the poore talent which I offer vnto
<pb facs="tcp:21007:3"/> you. But none of thoſe things could diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me in this buſineſſe: when I conſider, 1. Your moſt honourable, and fatherly care, over this Church, and State, of which you are members; receiving with all readineſſe, and mildneſſe, the complaints; yea of the meaneſt ſuters. 2. Your ſervice herein, will be acceptable to God; for, by his Law, The Foxes muſt be taken, that eate vp the Vines, yea, it is an honour, beyond earthly honour, to doe it: for thereby a name is purchaſed, excelling humane titles: even the name, to be called <hi>Good ſervants,</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> vnto the Lord God; and they are alſo <hi>admitted into their Maiſters ioy.</hi> Againe, this office is moſt ſeemly for your moſt high and honourable Court: becauſe, You are (therefore) called together, by his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maieſtie, our moſt gracious King: That things amiſſe might be redreſſed: And, the redreſſe of evils in the Church, and our faith, is of all other, moſt comely, and gracefull: for, thereby, the Word of God receiveth freer paſſage, and mens ſalvation is furthered. The doctrine of our Church, doth call for your protection againſt all intruders, (even of it ſelfe) though all men ſhould hold their peace:
<pb facs="tcp:21007:4"/> Becauſe, it deſerveth protection, in as much as it was penned, and compoſed, by moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, learned, and holy Authors, &amp; Fathers of our Church. It is in it ſelfe, moſt agreeable vnto the divine, and ſacred Revelation: yea, wanting nothing, any kind of wayes, of a ſafe, and fit expreſſion of, and direction vnto, our Chriſtian faith: ſo as we may truly ſay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not inferiour therein, vnto any Church in the Chriſtian world. Laſtly, This cauſe does indeed, in a ſpeciall ſort belong vnto you, for you are poſſeſſed with it (in part) alreadie. This doctrine of our Church received the authoritie it hath, firſt, from that moſt high and honourable Court, whereof you are. By it alſo it hath bin preſerved in that ſtate, till this preſent time. Wherefore I reſt well aſſured, That you will not impute my boldneſſe vnto me. Now, I might alledge ſome reaſons to moue you, to vndertake the worke: but I will not doe ſo. For that would be very vnſeemely and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting: For what man (well adviſed) would light a ſmall and dimme candle, to further the light of the Sunne in his greateſt ſtrength? And this would be my caſe, if I ſhould moue
<pb facs="tcp:21007:4"/> you by reaſons: For you know more then I can write or ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Who would put him forward, that is more ready to doe, then any can be to aske? And this is your caſe, experience doth witneſſe it: In whom we ſee not the ſpirit of <hi>Iehu,</hi> that was zealous for the Lord of Hoſts, but rather of the Lord of heaven and earth, who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to heare before we call vpon him; yea, to call to vs, when we are negligent to call vpon him. And thus would you doe, if it were fit for your place and authoritie: ſo mindfull, willing, &amp; ready are you in Gods ſervice, and the good of your Countrey. Wherfore I haue onely this to ſay, <hi>Goe on—For the Lord is with you.</hi> We your Countrey-men, true lovers of our Church and State, are with you, to helpe you with our prayers vnto God, to render thanks vnto God, and our gracious &amp; renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soveraigne: and to you, ſaying, in the words (once) ſpoken by King <hi>David; Bleſſed be God,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed be You.</hi> And to giue his ſacred Majeſty, and You, the honour due vnto you; ſaying, <hi>Many of your Predeceſſors haue done well, but You ſurmount them all.</hi> Thus I commit You and

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough, I haue no delight in making a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: for I ſee not any great need of it: yet I here preſent thee with one, becauſe, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome calls for it. In this Preface, I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee of ſome things, even of ſuch (and no more) as ſhall helpe thee, to make the better vſe of the enſuing Diſcourſe; which, I will doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with as much brevitie as I can. Firſt know, That, this Treatiſe was chiefly intended for my owne ſatisfaction, but is now publiſhed for the benefit of others. The manner of handling the poynts in it, is ſcholaſticall; and it might be no other; becauſe the things themſelues, and the partie oppoſed, require it. Beſides, this courſe of writing is profitable for thee; for thereby, 1. The matters in queſtion, are layd before thee nakedly, and, as it were, in both ends of the Ballance. 2. All impertinent Diſcourſes are prevented, and all ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings avoyded: ſo as, now thou haſt nothing to iudge of, but the matter it ſelfe. I haue directed my Diſputation against both of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> his Bookes; The <hi>Gagge,</hi> and the Appeale: becauſe the whole evill, could not be found out, in any one of them alone. All the ſentences, and ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, in this Diſcourſe, pretended to be collected, and framed out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> his Bookes, are truly, and plainly, and ingenuouſly collected, and framed according as they are in his Bookes themſelues. If any errour be committed in them, it ariſeth from the greatnes of their number, or from his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb facs="tcp:21007:6"/> manner of ſetting downe his intent. It may be, ſome will account the publiſhing hereof to be needleſſe: becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done ſo much already, as is fit to be done, in this buſineſſe. I anſwer; The publiſhing hereof, is to good purpoſe: For, many witneſſes to the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giues the greater glory to it, and procures a freer paſſage for it, amongst men: Beſides, I doubt not, but, by this Diſcourſe, the Reader ſhall be put in minde, of ſome things, which he would haue forgotten, or not obſerved, in the Bookes that are publiſhed already. Laſtly, None of this kinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue beene publiſhed already: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, more poynts are handled, then were touched in them: and, theſe which are diſcuſſed in this, are framed in another manner, and doe tend to an end, which they did not. I haue concealed my name: not becauſe I am, (or haue cauſe to be) vnwilling it ſhould be knowne: But becauſe, I deſire to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall perſonall quarrells; ſo frequent with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague:</hi> And, becauſe, I ſuppoſe, the annexing of my name hereto, is of no great vſe vnto the Reader; for as much, as he must receiue ſatisfaction, in the poynts of faith, from the divine teſtimony, not from any humane authoritie whatſoever. One thing (onely) remaines: That is, That, I intreat thee, to ſeeke for ſatisfaction, and an aſſured ground, for thy faith, in the preſent queſtions: For, it is thy dutie ſo to doe.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Mountague</hi> hath corrupted, the Faith of the Church of England.</head>
               <p>THE whole Diſputation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſerveth to proue this ſentence; by ſhewing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and by what, he hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it. This ſentence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath publiſhed her faith, which will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, becauſe the Records thereof (cheifly the Booke of <hi>Articles</hi>) are, or may be in every mans hand.</p>
               <p>That he hath corrupted it, will eaſily be granted too, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if I ſhew, that vnder the name and pretence of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and defence thereof, he hath brought in the erronious faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arminius.</hi> And this I will performe; firſt, by anſwering his generall <hi>plea</hi> to excuſe himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from in this Chapter, and then by ſetting downe the particular points wherein, and whereby he hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, in the reſt of the Chapters following.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:21007:10"/>
               <p>Firſt, he pleadeth not guiltie of both accuſations, <hi>of</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Arminianiſme, and Popery. Appeale. p.</hi> 9. I reply vnto him. I will joyne iſſue with him herein, and make it good that he is guiltie.</p>
               <p>He would argue his innocency on this manner. 1. <hi>I diſavowed the name and title of Arminian; for I will not pinne my beliefe vnto any mans ſleeue.</hi> I anſwere, if you joyne in that faith, whereof he was the author, you cannot avoyd to beare his title; no more then others that haue <hi>ſided</hi> in the like caſe. Every artiſt beareth the name of that art which he profeſſeth, but you joyne in faith with him, (as afterwards ſhall appeare) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt beare his title. 2. He ſaith, <hi>he never read word in Arminius. p.</hi> 10. I anſwere, this will not thruſt off his title. For of them that were called <hi>Arrians,</hi> many thouſands never read word in <hi>Arrius.</hi> It is communion in his faith, (not his writings) that procures that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
               <p>He would proue himſelfe innocent of the Popiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> faith on this manner; <hi>I nor am, nor haue beene, nor intend to be, a Papiſt of ſtate or of Religion. p.</hi> 111. I anſwer, his thoughts may change, and ſo he may be, what he doth not now intend to be; The liking of ſome points firſt, is a good beginning, and a fayre way, to like all at laſt. We doe not inquire what you are, or intend to be, but what you haue done. Therefore this <hi>plea</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>He would proue he neither is nor meanes to be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>Papiſt,</hi> by two reaſons; the firſt is, <hi>The originall grounds of Popery haue no warrant from revealed truth. p.</hi> 111. The ſecond is, <hi>he hath handled them as few beſides himſelfe hath done, in ſo exaſperating a ſtile. p.</hi> 110. I anſwer, this proues
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21007:10"/> the thing which is not in queſtion, therefore deſerues not be anſwered: but to them, I ſay, you haue left a dore open for the firſt (to eſcape.) You ſay, <hi>you are not tyed to your owne opinion. Gagg. p.</hi> 328. If your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment change, you are as ready for <hi>Popery,</hi> and will judge it no leſſe warranted by revealed truth then now you doe the contrary. You tell vs of <hi>ſome that draw one way, and looke another.</hi> You may be one of them for any thing is done, &amp; are ſo too (in all likelihood.) For ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at them doth not ſhew you had no favour to them, becauſe the contention of friends many times is the bittereſt, and odious rayling, was the fitteſt curtaine to conceale your friendſhip to them, where open friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would preſently haue beene deteſted.</p>
               <p>If circumſtances will argue your guiltineſſe, I can vrge you with ſome ſtore. 1. Your writing is crabbed and hardly intelligible, full of raylings and debaſing of others, extolling &amp; vaunting of your ſelfe, advancing the credit of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers, debaſing the reputation of many of precious accompt in all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Churches. 2. You often times leaue the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to quarrell with <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> 3. You grant your Adverſary many points of his faith, and faine a difference where there is none. 4. You drop in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faith here ſome, and there ſome, as if you would, but you are not willing to be ſeene. If they were together, every one would perceiue them, being in ſunder, a wiſe man might be overtaken by them. 5. You bring in points of ſpeculation, that will finde leſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but being received, will draw on matters of practice. 6. You profeſſe your ſelfe for <hi>reconciliation,</hi> which can be vnderſtood of none, but with the church of <hi>Rome. Appeale. p.</hi> 292.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:21007:11"/>
               <p>Touching the matter it ſelfe, thus he ſaith; <hi>I call ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for tryall for it, by God and my Countrey, the Scriptures, and the Church of England; dare any ioyne Iſſue with me vpon this, they dare not. p.</hi> 9. I anſwer, I dare and doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Challenge. And that the proceedings may be orderly, I will ſet the doctrine of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountague</hi> in the firſt place, of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond, and of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the third. Then I will ſhew his diſagreement with <hi>ours</hi> and agreement with <hi>theirs.</hi> In the laſt place, I will ſhew the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> (wherein he doth agree with them) to be erronious.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The point ſet downe in the former Chapter is diſcuſſed.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place the meaning of the terme <hi>Iudge</hi> muſt be vnderſtood, which is thus explicated;</p>
               <p>A Iudge is an office, ordained by God, to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a doubt that is made, in things revealed by God.</p>
               <p>This office hath theſe three properties. 1. The ſentence thereof muſt be regulated by the Word of God. 2. All parties contending muſt appeale vnto it. And 3. they muſt reſt ſatisfied with the Iudgement thereof. Of which there is no queſtion with him in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie queſtions that be in Controverſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts to be debated be three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether that propoſition <hi>the Church is Iudge,</hi> &amp;c. be true or not.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether that propoſition <hi>conſenteth with the Church of Rome,</hi> or not.</item>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21007:12"/>
                  <item>3. Whether that propoſition <hi>diſſenteth from the Church of England,</hi> or not.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Touching the firſt he ſayth. <hi>The Word of God, and the auncient practice of the Catholicke Church doth avow it. gagg. p.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Doctor <hi>Carleton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> ſayth all contrary in his booke called <hi>Directions to know the true Church, p.</hi> 54. He writeth thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vndoubtedly, the written Word doth ſuffice to end all Controverſies of faith; this is the Catholicke determination of the Iudge of Controverſies of faith, which hath beene in all ſucceſsion preſerved.</hi> And p. 57. <hi>Till the Councell of Trent, the Church held the ſame determination ſtill concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Iudge of Controverſies in faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now vnto whether of you too ſhall credit be given, ſurely vnto him rather then vnto you. For he is your ſuperior in learning and authoritie, he is your Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, whoſe voyce muſt you heare, but the voyce of your Paſtour? And you are in the Affirmatiue, giving an authoritie to the Church, which he denieth; you muſt ſhew vs the commiſſion for this authoritie, for we dare not yeeld the Church that office without knowledge of a commiſſion for it. <hi>It is your owne rule gagg. p.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>A Nunci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> muſt goe to his Commiſsion.</p>
               <p>If your proofes be good, your Dioceſan muſt ſtand by.</p>
               <p>1. Your proofes from the word of God, we find <hi>p.</hi> 17. taken out of <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. thus to be framed:</p>
               <p>Whom we are commanded to <hi>heare, Luk.</hi> 10. 16. They are Iudge in Divinitie Controverſies.</p>
               <p>But the Church. (That is) the Governours of the Church which ſucceed the Apoſtles, are thoſe whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21007:12"/> we are commanded to <hi>heare, Luk.</hi> 10. 16. Therefore the Church is Iudge, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the propoſition is falſe. I ſhew it by many reaſons. 1. It doth alledge this place of <hi>Luke</hi> as if that office of a Iudge were inſtituted by this place, in which reſpect the propoſition is falſe, becauſe that office is not inſtituted in that place. And this I take as granted. 2. At leaſt the propoſition reſumes, that that office was already inſtituted, when thoſe words <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. were ſpoken. Which is falſe alſo, and I could ſhew it by many reaſons; but this one ſhall ſuffice, <hi>viz.</hi> no place of Scripture doth tender vnto vs the commiſſion for that office. 3. The word <hi>heare,</hi> may be vnderſtood for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon hearing of the Word of God Preached and read, as well as for <hi>an appeale thereto, and reſting in the ſentence of a Iudge:</hi> yea and better alſo; for it is moſt frequently vſed in that ſence, but little in this. Againe, the Text leadeth clearely to that ſence; but not at all to this.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption ſpeakes of the governours of the Church, ſevered from other Miniſters which are not governours. In which ſence the aſſumption doth need proofe, but he hath brought none: but his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. Beſides, the aſſumption is falſe by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Text it ſelfe, which ſendeth vs to all the Apoſtles ſucceſſors joyntly, by the terme <hi>you,</hi> which diſtinguiſheth not betweene one ſucceſſor and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>His proofe from the word of God being diſpatched. The ancient practiſe of the Catholike Church comes next, but he ſayes nothing of it, therefore I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere any thing to it.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21007:13"/>
               <p>It may be he lookes for proofe from vs out of former times, to ſhew that</p>
               <p>The Church is not Iudge in matters of faith.</p>
               <p>Which is vnorderly: yet notwithſtanding to the end that the Iudgement of Antiquitie in this point might be fully knowne. Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi> in the booke alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>p.</hi> 52. &amp;c. alledgeth Councels, Fathers, &amp; Popes, all pronouncing this ſentence.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is Iudge in Controverſies of faith.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt hearken to your Paſtour, and not to you.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Church be Iudge of Controverſies of faith, then God hath aſſured vnto it an infaillibilitie and freedome from error in Iudgement, And aſſured ſuch a conſpicuous being vnto the Church, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the end of the world, that it may be fit to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed vnto, and giue ſentence in every Controverſie of faith, in the time wherein it riſeth, for without the firſt it cannot be a fit Iudge for matters of that kinde, and without the ſecond, ſome Controverſies of faith might reſt vndecided: But the Church hath neither of theſe two aſſured vnto it by God, as my anſwers in the two next Chapters will ſhew: and therefore the Church is not Iudge in matters of faith.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond thing propounded to be debated in this point, I preſume he will anſwer that he doth not conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point, and giue this for his reaſon; to wit, <hi>he and they doe take the word Church in a different ſence, and giue for inſtance as he doth. gagg. p.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>He takes the Church to ſignifie <hi>a true, not a pretended Church,</hi> which they doe not.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:21007:13"/>
               <p>And againe, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 122. He takes the <hi>Church for a general Councell with the Pope as a patriarchcall Biſhop, but without the Pope as head;</hi> but they doe not ſo. <hi>By Church they vnderſtand the Pope alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; this Diſcourſe evidently declares that he agrees with them in the nature of the office of Iudging, and in the ſubject that receiveth it, abſtracted from particulars (namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Church) and differs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the aſſigning, in particular which is the Church. Whereby he agrees with them in the principall thing in queſtion, and that is enough.</p>
               <p>But indeed he doth agree in this point with the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> to the full, which vnderſtands by the word <hi>Church, a true, not a pretended Church, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, not the Pope onely.</hi> For it calls that Church (in the words immediately going before) <hi>the Mother of all beleevers.</hi> Which name cannot agree vnto a <hi>pretended Church, nor to the Pope alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doe the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> expound the word <hi>Church,</hi> by the word <hi>Pope:</hi> but onely doe apply that ſentence of the <hi>Councell</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> by inference and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is apparent by the whole courſe of their diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: The ſumme whereof may be comprehended in ſuch a Syllogiſme as this is.</p>
               <p>That office of teaching which belongs to the Church. belongs to the Pope, and his Councell.</p>
               <p>But this office of teaching, <hi>viz. Iudging of Divinitie Controverſies,</hi> belongs to the Church.</p>
               <p>Therefore that office belongs to the Pope and his Councell.</p>
               <p>The propoſition (they ſay) is true, becauſe Teaching is formally in the Paſtors, &amp; (otherwiſe then by them)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21007:14"/> the Church cannot teach. It muſt be a Councell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Paſtors ſingly may erre. The Pope muſt be joynd with them, becauſe it belongs to him, to gather, direct, and confirme Councels.</p>
               <p>In the aſſumption of this reaſon, he conſenteth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that is the principall part of this Argument. In the propoſition he conſenteth with them thus farre, That this <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ching</hi> belongs to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> of the Church vniverſally, and to the <hi>Pope</hi> as one of them, and that in a Councell. He onely denieth the Popes authoritie, to <hi>call, direct, and confirme Councels,</hi> which is the laſt, and leaſt part of this Argument.</p>
               <p>All which being conſidered, we may ſafely conclude, that he agreeth in the point of the <hi>Iudge in Divinitie Controverſies,</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be debated in this queſtion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth, <hi>gagg. p. 13. 14. &amp; 15. That it is the ſentence of the Church of England,</hi> and doth alledge the 21. <hi>Article</hi> for it, ſaying, the <hi>Church hath authoritie in Controverſies of faith.</hi> But all this is vntrue. I haue ſet downe that <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> in the former Chapter, the ſight whereof will avow it. Yea the <hi>Article</hi> is full for the contrary. For 1. It giues the title of <hi>witneſſe of the Scriptures</hi> vnto the Church, and the Church cannot be both a witneſſe and a Iudge of the Scriptures. 2. It calls the Church the <hi>keeper of the Scriptures</hi> and no more. Which it muſt haue done, if it had eſteemed it to be the Iudge, to apply and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scriptures. 3. It reſtraines the force of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church, <hi>To examination and tryall by the Scriptures.</hi> But ſo muſt not the ſentence giuen by that Iudge, which muſt be received, as the dictates of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:21007:14"/>
               <p>The Concluſion is, He diſſenteth from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>I anſwer, this explication ſerues well to puzzell the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Reader, but hath no force to cleare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> from agreeing with the Ch: of <hi>Rome,</hi> for many reaſons.</p>
               <p>The terme <hi>fundamentall</hi> is borrowed. We ſhall then know the true ſence of it, when we know what a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in proper ſpeech. A foundation is that part, whervpon the reſt of the building is placed. <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of faith</hi> muſt be like vnto this; they muſt be ſuch whervpon ſome other thing is builded, which is borne vp, and ſuſtained by ſuch <hi>points of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things <hi>acceſſory</hi> are ſuch as are attendants, not things principall in being or cauſalitie: This being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ſay,</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, the diſtinction it ſelfe is naught. No points of ſaith be acceſſory, all are fundamentall, in as much as the whole divine Revelation, and every particular propoſition thereof, is the foundation of our ſalvation which is built therevpon.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſaith the <hi>Homilie</hi> of reading the Scriptures, 1. <hi>part,</hi> where it calleth the Word of God, the <hi>foundation wherevpon the wiſe builder doth build.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth ſay no leſſe, when he ſaith, <hi>We are built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 2. 20. And the thing it ſelfe doth fay the ſame, for as much as there is no ſentence, in the divine Revelation, but doth conduce to everlaſting happineſſe.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21007:16"/>
               <p>2. His deſcription of a <hi>fundamentall point of faith,</hi> is of his own deviſing, without warrant of the thing it ſelfe, or any other Author. He doth alledge, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 128. Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> for his Author thereof: but falſely. The Biſhop (even as he hath alledged him) hath not one word of a <hi>fundamentall point of faith,</hi> that hath any place in this queſtion.</p>
               <p>3. The deſcription (as it lyeth) is not intelligible, how a foundation can be as <hi>eſſentiall to the thing built therevpon,</hi> as the <hi>ſoule is to man,</hi> paſſeth humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſeing mans ſoule is the primary eſſence of man; a foundation is but part of the matter, whereof the building is made. Againe, what he meanes by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,</hi> needs a ſecond explication, there is nothing in his diſcourſe that ſhews it.</p>
               <p>4. To what the points of faith be fundamentall, he ſhewes not: this therefore muſt be vnderſtood, becauſe <hi>points of faith</hi> are <hi>fundamentall</hi> divers wayes, 1. Some points are fundamentall to other ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> this point, <hi>There is a God,</hi> is fundamentall to all other points of faith. The like inſtance may be given in many other points, wherin the primary are the foundations to the ſecondary points of faith. 2. Points of faith are the foundations to our ſalvation. 3. Points of faith are the foundation to the Church, in as much as the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the pure Word of God therein, doth ſerue vnto the being of a Church, in the Iudgement of the Church of <hi>England. Arti:</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>He yeeldeth vs another deſcription, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 116. in theſe words; <hi>Points fundamentall be ſuch as are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate vnto faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proues this, as he did the former, (juſt never a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21007:16"/> whit.) We muſt beleeue it to be thus, becauſe he ſaith it. We muſt gueſſe at his meaning, for he doth not tell it vs. I thinke by <hi>immediate vnto faith,</hi> he meanes ſuch points as are obiected vnto faith firſt &amp; before others, ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz. That there is a God,</hi> is beleeved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other points that concerne vertue and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <hi>That there is a divine Revelation,</hi> is beleeved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other that concerne ſupernaturall holines and happines; <hi>That there is a Mediator, the man Chriſt,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved before all others, that doe directly tend to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He being thus vnderſtood, his deſcription is falſe, for the <hi>primary or firſt obiecting vnto ſaith</hi> giues them not any thing like to the <hi>foundation of a building.</hi> It is the ſucceeding Articles of faith (which doth ſuppoſe the precedent) that make the preceding to haue the likeneſſe of a foundation. This Article, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> is a foundation to all others vniverſally, becauſe all of them doe follow and ſuppoſe this. 2. Some Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are fundamentall, which are not <hi>obiected firſt vnto faith,</hi> for <hi>that there is a divine Revelation,</hi> is not obiected firſt vnto faith, yet it is the foundation vnto all other Articles of divine faith. The like inſtance may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of many other Articles, which are foundations in the like ſort: which yet are obiected vnto faith many degrees after the firſt.</p>
               <p>He doth explicate theſe fundamentalls, by theſe properties: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The knowledge and beliefe of them is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: no man can be ſaved, that doth not know and beleeue them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſome points haue theſe properties I grant, and namely, thoſe three I haue alreadie ſpoken of: but that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21007:17"/> theſe properties are ſo peculiar vnto fundamentalls, as that they belong vnto them all, and vnto none but ſuch (which is the thing he intendeth) he hath not proved, nor can. Beſides, this neceſſary order between ſome points of faith and heaven, doth not make them fundamentall, becauſe that neceſſitie ariſeth from the things themſelues, in reſpect that they are the entrance into the way to heaven.</p>
               <p>5. The application of the diſtinction is falſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p>He doth not conceiue the <hi>Church to be infallible in fundamentalls.</hi> For if he did, then alſo he doth giue the Church authoritie to Iudge in fundamentalls, becauſe that goeth with this. But he doth not giue the Church that authoritie, but denieth it vnto them. Which I proue by his owne teſtimony.</p>
               <p>1. In his <hi>Appeale</hi> he diſputeth, <hi>p.</hi> 126. in this forme, and in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Councels are to determine things which be of doubtfull iſſue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fundamentalls are no ſuch.</p>
               <p>Out of which propoſition and aſſumption, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion iſſueth.</p>
               <p>Therefore Councels are not to determine points fundamentall.</p>
               <p>2. Out of his <hi>Gagg</hi> and <hi>Appeale,</hi> I argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Divinitie queſtions and controverted matters, the Church is Iudge. gagg. p.</hi> 14. &amp; 28.</p>
               <p>Fundamentalls are not divinitie queſtions, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted matters.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Fundamentalls be plainely delivered in Scripture. Appeale. p.</hi> 125.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church is not Iudge in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21007:17"/>
               <p>Although theſe things which I haue anſwered, be ſufficient (I hope) to take away the reaſon, which he pleadeth to excuſe himſelfe, from agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: yet I will adde a reaſon from his owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the thing it ſelfe, to proue that his agreement, on this manner:</p>
               <p>If he doth giue to the Church infallibility in points fundamentall, all points of faith be fundamentall, then he doth agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of the Churches infallibilitie. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth giue infallibilitie to the Church in all points of faith. But he doth giue infallibilitie to the Church in points fundamentall. And all points of faith be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall. 1. To mans ſalvation. 2. One to another. 3. To the Church (as ſhall be proved if need require)</p>
               <p>Therefore he doth conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of the Churches infallibilitie.</p>
               <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice touching the ſecond point.</p>
               <p>That he doth diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the words on both ſides ſet downe in the beginning of this Chapter doe ſufficiently ſhew; ſo that to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ow further labour therein, is indeed altogether loſt, yet notwithſtanding, that it may appeare to be ſo, without all exception, I will anſwer to thoſe proofes which he alledgeth to excuſe himſelfe therefrom; which are as followeth, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 128. The firſt whereof muſt be framed thus:</p>
               <p>That poſſibilitie of erring, which <hi>Arti:</hi> 19. aſcribeth to generall Councels, is in things wherein they haue erred. For</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21007:18"/>
               <p>It avou cheth, that generall Councels haue erred.</p>
               <p>But <hi>in fundamentalls they haue never erred, becauſe there is no ſuch extant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Article doth not aſcribe poſſibilitie of erring to generall Councels in fundamentalls.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, this argument proues nothing, but begs the queſtion, in that</p>
               <p>1. It takes as granted, ſome points of faith be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> other ſome are not, which is denied him.</p>
               <p>2. The aſſumption is as doubtfull as the concluſion. The propoſition is alſo falſe, the words of the Article attributeth vnto the church poſſibility of erring, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation, either indefinite or aſſigned It ſaith,</p>
               <p>Generall Councels may erre in things appertaining to God.</p>
               <p>If this propoſition be vnderſtood, to ſpeake not of all, but of ſome things pertaining to God, then nothing is determined thereby of certaintie, but that may not be granted; for that is a deluſion, no deciſion.</p>
               <p>The proofe added to the propoſition confirmes it not, for that propoſition is not a limitation of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels erring: but a proofe that Councels may erre; on this wiſe:</p>
               <p>Councels haue erred.</p>
               <p>Therefore Councels may erre.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, that this reaſon is not good, except <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                  <hi>erring</hi> in the conſequent be taken, in that ſence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is vſed in the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>I rejoynd, the argument is good, although <hi>erring</hi> in the antecedent, be taken for <hi>erring</hi> in ſome things, and erring in the conſequent be taken for erring in all things, becauſe the Church that is not free from error
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21007:18"/> in ſome points of faith, is not free at all.</p>
               <p>The proofe added to the aſſumption ſtandeth thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which hath not erred hither to, cannot erre hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this propoſition is manifeſtly falſe, becauſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from error, and infallibilitie in Iudgement, is not made by not erring in time paſt, but by a ſpeciall &amp; peculiar providence of God, which they may want at ſome other time, who (in the thing) haue not erred in time foregoing.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is in <hi>p.</hi> 124. after this ſort. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Article ſpeakes of things pertaining to God, and thoſe are not all fundamentalls, then it may be vnderſtood of things not fundamentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, this reaſon hath the fault that the former had, it preſumes that points of faith, are ſome funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, ſome not fundamentall, which is denied, and therefore it begs the queſtion. 2. I will grant the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction for this time, and ſay further, the word (only) muſt be added to the latter part of this reaſon, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it concludeth nothing to purpoſe; that being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I deny the conſequence, becauſe the Article ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of all things pertaining to God, as I haue proved in my anſwer. And I proue further by your own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, thus;</p>
               <p>If the Article in ſaying <hi>Councels may erre in things, &amp;c.</hi> doe not meane all but ſome things, then the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not plaine direct, without far-fetched obſcure interpretations, caſie even &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous of it ſelfe, fitted for the vſe, capacitie, &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſimple and ignorant, who are not capable of obſcurities.</p>

               <p>His third reaſon is in the ſame. <hi>p.</hi> 124 thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Article ſpeaketh of debating and diſcuſſing,</p>

               <p>Therefore I diſſent not from the Article.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the 1. branch of the Antecedent is falſe. Ordeining is deciding and determining. The Article ſpeaketh of ordaining. Thus it argueth Councels may erre.</p>
               <p>Therefore things ordained by them, not taken out of Scripture, haue no authoritie.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Article ſpeaketh of deciding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining.</p>
               <p>His fourth reaſon is in <hi>p.</hi> 125. to this effect. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>

               <p>I anſwer, the words <hi>plainly delivered in Scripture,</hi> muſt ſignifie things not in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſie. That being granted, the ſecond branch in the antecedent is falſe. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe other-where delivereth the contrary.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>There is a rule of faith, we acknowledge it.

               <p>I anſwer, There is no whole part in this argument; Not in the propoſition, which ſuppoſeth, that</p>
               <p>Theſe words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. were ſpoken to ſome which haue an office to Iudge, whether this or that ſentence in Divinitie, be agreeable to the Scriptures or not.</p>
               <p>But this ſuppoſition is of his owne making, and hath beene refuted in the laſt Chapter going before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth appeare by my anſwer to him. That office was never committed to any. Wherefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth indeed beg; but not demonſtrate the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>

                  </gap>tion thereof, I may thus argue If theſe words were ſpoken to ſome that had that office, then the Apoſtles had it. For thoſe words were ſpoken to the Apoſtles (I take as granted.) But the Apoſtles had it not; for they had the office to reveale the ſacred myſteries, with which the office in queſtion was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fit to ſtand. It cannot be imagined, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles would lay aſide that power and authoritie of revealing, and ſubmit themſelues to the office of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and expoſition of things already revealed; this being inferior, as the building, that ſuperior, as the foundation; that being performed without labour and induſtry, this not without much of both; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an immediate continuation of Chriſts miniſtery, this mediate: none of which may be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall direction in the Word of God, wherein
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21007:20"/> there is not a word whereon we may build any ſuch conceit.</p>
               <p>Moreover, although this exception were not taken, yet the propoſition is falſe. Theſe words may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſuch as haue not that office, this <hi>leading into all truth,</hi> and that office of applying and expounding things revealed, doth not neceſſarily goe together. The word, <hi>leading,</hi> may ſignifie no more, but an act of doing ſo much as is required on Gods part, which hath not alwayes the event accordingly, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is fruſtrate by mans default. 2. The words; <hi>all truth,</hi> may import no more, but that whole which is required vnto the ſalvation of every particular man, ſo neceſſarily, that without it that cannot be had. The aſſumption is no better, the Text alledged hath not one word touching a generall Councell: If it be reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe words were ſpoken to the Apoſtles, and from them to the Paſtors of the Church which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, and becauſe thoſe Paſtors cannot conſult and giue ſentence touching a thing in queſtion, except they meet together, therefore theſe words were ſpoken of a generall Councell. To this I rejoyne. The Text thus explicated, yeeldeth theſe queſtions. 1. Who are the Paſtors of the Church. 2. In what reſpect thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors doe ſucceed the Apoſtles. 3. Who hath the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to gather the Paſtors of the Church together. 4. Whether all or ſome, and what number of Paſtors haue authoritie to determine. 5. Of what value their determination and ſentence is. 6. From whence their determination receiveth ſtrength; all which queſtions are no leſſe doubtfull, then the concluſion which the Text is brought to proue; whereby it doth beg the queſtion, but proues it not.</p>

               <p>In this place it is taken in the firſt ſence: otherwiſe the argument would be ridiculous. That being ſo taken, it is manifeſt.</p>

               <p>Anſwer to <hi>Hardings</hi> concluſion.</p>
               <p>From whence I thus argue;</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is departed from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to avoyd damnation.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> Iudgeth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be no true Church.</p>
               <p>And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> doth profeſſe himſelfe to be no Child of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Thus he writeth. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. p.</hi> 112.</p>
               <p>I profeſſe my ſelfe none of thoſe furious ones in point of difference now adayes, whoſe profeſsion and roſolution is that the further in any thing from communion with the Church of Rome, the neerer vnto God and truth. That we ought to haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce, ſocietie, or accordance with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in things divine, vpon paine of eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>Much joy may he haue, in that his good temper and communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will harken

               <p>That this propoſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of Rome is a true Church.</p>
               <p>Is falſe and vntrue, will appeare by my anſwer to his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Before I come vnto that, I muſt ſet downe what he meaneth by true Church, which I find written. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. p.</hi> 140. in theſe words;</p>
               <p>It is a true Church in reſpect of the eſſence and being of a Church, not a ſound Church every way in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               <p>Although this diſtinction be liable to many juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, yet I paſſe by it, and come to the propoſition in queſtion, which according to his owne expoſition muſt be conceiud in theſe termes.</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome hath the eſſence and being of a true Church.</p>
               <p>His proofes for this we find written in his <hi>Appeale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 113. the firſt whereof is ſet downe in theſe words;</p>
               <p>I am abſolutely perſwaded the Church of Rome is a true Church, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, his perſwaſion (though never ſo abſolute) is no compotent rule for any divinitie queſtion, much leſſe for this, which doth ſo neerly concern an Article of faith, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would haue it. It may be the other two reaſons, which he hath for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is the ground for this his abſolute perſwaſion, therefore I paſſe from this, and come to the ſecond, in theſe words;</p>
               <p>In eſſentialls and fundamentalls they agree.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:21007:27"/>
               <p>I anſwer, this is a very riddle, and no proofe. What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> he meanes by eſſentials, what by fundamentalls, with whom, or what they agree, he ſheweth not; nor are the things evident of themſelues. When he ſpeaketh to humane intelligence, he ſhall haue anſwer. <hi>If the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet giue an vncertaine ſound, none can prepare himſelfe to battell.</hi> Let vs ayme at his meaning, it will open the whole Cauſe the better. It may be, by fundamentalls, he meanes ſuch Articles of faith, as muſt be beleeved <hi>explicitly vnto ſalvation.</hi> If this be his meaning, I deny that they agree in fundamentals; for in ſuch Articles they haue no divine faith, becauſe the immediate and formall reaſon of that their beliefe, is the authoritie of the Pope and his Councell, whoſe ſentence is humane and not divine, for want of a Commiſſion from God for that office, as hath beene ſhewed, Chap. 3.</p>
               <p>His third proofe is comprehended in theſe words, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                  <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 113.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They hold one faith, in one Lord,</hi> into whom they are inſerted, <hi>through one Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, this wanteth not obſcuritie; he ſeemeth to eſteeme himſelfe ſafeſt, when he is leaſt vnderſtood. I ſuppoſe he would ſay thus;</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome teacheth the ſame faith which God reveald, and hath the ſame Sacraments which Christ inſtituted.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, if he were as able to proue, as he is readie with confidence to affirme, I would grant him the queſtion vpon this onely reaſon.</p>
               <p>But the ſpight is, he hath no proofe at all, and his owne word is not ſufficient, therefore we are where we were, ſee how handſomely he diſputes.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:21007:27"/>
               <p>In the laſt argument, he gaue them agreement <hi>in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of faith</hi> (that is to ſay) in ſome, not in all points, for <hi>all points of faith, be not fundamentall, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe avoucheth, Appeale. p.</hi> 124. In this he giveth them agreement in all points of faith; a ſodaine change; there ſome, not all; here all, not ſome. The matter it ſelfe of this argument, ſhall be further handled anon, <hi>num.</hi> 13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He will ſupply this want, by the authoritie of <hi>Ianius,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> who is neither <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Arminian;</hi> his words are theſe.</p>
               <p>The Papall Church, is a Church according to that it hath, which belongeth vnto the definition of a Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is very doubtfull, whether this ſentence be truly alledged or not, becauſe it neither affirmeth nor denieth any thing of certaintie; but let it paſſe as it is, it maketh nothing for you. He muſt ſay,</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome, hath the eſſence and being of a true Church.</p>
               <p>For ſo ſay you. But of this he hath not a word. If you ſay, he ſuppoſeth</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome hath ſomething belonging to the definition of a Church.</p>
               <p>I rejoynd, he may ſo ſuppoſe, and yet not agree with you; for that ſuppoſall may be a <hi>conceſsion in curteſie, and not an affirmation of a truth;</hi> which two things doe really differ in your owne judgement, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 14. when it was your owne caſe. Of this judgement I hope you are ſtill, now the caſe doth not concerne your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And there is great diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rence between ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the definition of a Church, and the eſſence whereof you ſpeake; for that muſt ſignifie part of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21007:28"/> eſſence, and may ſignifie the generall thing, wherein the Church doth agree with other ſocieties; this muſt be taken for the ſpecificall and adequate being of the Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I will willingly grant him, the Church of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſomething pertaining to the definition of a Church, and that it is a Church according to it; and this is all he alledgeth out of <hi>Iunius,</hi> yea, I will aſſigne him, what that ſomething is, <hi>viz.</hi> It is a <hi>company of men on earth,</hi> which pertaineth to the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Church, by the confeſſion of them and our Church. The 19. Article ſayth, <hi>the Church is a Congregation of men;</hi> and ſo ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, de eccle. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 2. And more then ſo, I will grant him, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo farre forth a Church (that is to ſay) a company of men joyned together in one ſocietie, by one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bond; but this will profit him nothing, as is manifeſt by the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus farre all the allegations which he maketh to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> perſwade, that <hi>the Church of Rome is a true Church,</hi> haue beene examined, and found too weake, for his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſwaſion that it is <hi>a true Church</hi> to be grounded vpon. Wherefore I haue good reaſon to conclude this point in his owne words. <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 161.</p>
               <p>If you haue any ſpeciall illumination or aſſurance by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, or rather ſtrong perſwaſion, through affection, much good may it doe you, keepe it to your ſelfe, preſſe it not vpon others.</p>
               <p>To which I adde. If you will not be adviſed, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vpon ſo vaine a conceit, you do amongſt wiſe men but <hi>beate the arre,</hi> for as much as there is the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church in the Scriptures, and the authoritie

               <p>
                  <hi>It may ſeeme probable, that the Turkiſh ſtate may at leaſt be aſſumed into aſſociation with the Pope and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, in making vp that Antichriſt, and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdome, or ſtate oppoſite vnto the ſtate &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Scripture is our abſolute rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we conſent and agree, it is Antichriſtian to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from, to reiect that rule, and him an Antichriſt that doth ſo, or propoſeth any thing, as to be beleeved againſt that rule.

               <p>From hence, thus I argue;</p>
               <p>1. That Church which is Antichriſtian, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata, that hath departed from Chriſt, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doctrine, &amp; Scepter, that is no true Church: But according to you, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, and an Apoſtata, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:21007:29"/>
               <p>For according to you, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and an Apoſtata, &amp;c. And ſuch as the Pope is, ſuch is that Church, for as much as they receiue their faith from the Decree and determination of the Pope. Thus writeth <hi>Suarez, defide, &amp;c. tracta. 1. diſp. 5. ſect. 7. num.</hi> 6. &amp; 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A generall Councell, in which the Pope is preſent, either in his owne perſon, or by his Legates, and confirmed by the Pope, is an infallible rule of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this he alſo there ſaith, <hi>is a matter of faith.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>2. That Church which oppoſeth the Kingdome and ſtate of Chriſt, is not a true Church.</p>
               <p>But according to you, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Kingdome and ſtate of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For according to you, the Pope, Papacie, Popery, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Kingdome and ſtate of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore according to you, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a true Church.</p>
               <p>How this ſore ſhall be healed, it paſſeth the skill of all ſuch, whoſe learning exceedeth not the age of <hi>Plato.</hi> It may be, he hath ſome that is of an elder ſtamp; and by it can ſhew, how a church may be a runn away from Chriſt, and a houſhold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſervant vnto Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of Rome as now it ſtands, hath no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Catholike Church. p.</hi> 88. &amp; 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The preſent Church of Rome, is no Church of Chriſt, but an aſſemblie, I ſay not of heretikes, but of farre worſe and more dangerous, then any heretikes heretofore haue beene. p.</hi> 65.</p>
               <p>Touching the danger that they are in, which haue communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Popiſh doctrine, and the receivers thereof, he writeth thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe traps are layd with great ſubtiltie, to inthrall their ſoules, let them, at leaſt, that are ſeduced, lift vp their eyes, and ſee the ſnares that are provided to catch them, and behold the danger that is before them, if they will wilfully fall into theſe ſnares, then may they blame themſelues for their owne deſtruction. p.</hi> 63. &amp; 64.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The damage redoundeth to the deſtruction of their ſoules.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>This thing the ſimple people ought more carefully to looke to, more exactly to prevent, then any damage that can grow in their worldly ſtate. p.</hi> 43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meanes to be ſaved, are now taken away by theſe that are now in the Church of Rome. p.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p>Which teſtimony, as it is free from all exception that might any wayes diſable it, ſo alſo it caries with it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances of credit, eſpecially, to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 69.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sometimes he was his worthy friend and acquaintance, ſince is his reverend and much reverenced Dioceſan, his ſuperior in learning and authoritie.</hi> A thing much vrged by himſelfe. <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Vnto all men, I find theſe circumſtances, yeelding credit vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Church and ſtate doth take knowledge of him for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vertue; for it imployed him for our Church in the Synode of Dort, and that as the principall of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that were ſent thither,</hi> are M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> his owne words. <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 69. Since that, our Church hath advanced him vnto Dioceſan authoritie. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his teſtimony agreeth fully with the teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> ſet downe before, whoſe doctrine is indeed the doctrine of our Church; the booke it ſelfe is dedicated vnto his Maieſtie that now is, and thereby hath a Royall Confirmation and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But which is moſt of all, this teſtimony is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by cleare and evident demonſtration, which out of the ſayd booke is thus to be framed;</p>
               <p>Every particular aſſemblie that holdeth not vnitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> with the Catholike Church, is no true Church of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21007:30"/> Chriſt, but an aſſembly of heretickes. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>For the Church is but one, not two, nor many. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath broken off this vnitie with the Catholike Church. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Therefore the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no church of Chriſt, but an aſſemblie of heretickes. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption of this argument, he proveth thus;</p>
               <p>The Church is one, 1. by the vnitie of the body; 2. by the vnitie of the head; 3. by the vnitie of the ſpirit; 4. by the vnitie of faith. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>But the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not hold the vnitie by the body. <hi>p.</hi> 8. nor the vnitie of the head. <hi>p.</hi> 13. nor the vnitie of the ſpirit. <hi>p.</hi> 19. nor the vnitie of faith. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth not vnitie with the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>Although all thoſe are neceſſarily required to proue a Church, to hold vnitie with the Catholike Church, as he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 6. &amp; he bringeth proofes, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth not vnitie in any one of them, in the ſeverall places which I haue quoted, yet I will content my ſelfe to bring his proofe for the laſt, becauſe (as he truely alſo ſaith) <hi>where one of them is found, all of them are found. p.</hi> 7. And contrariwiſe.</p>
               <p>His proofe for the laſt, ſtandeth thus;</p>
               <p>They that hold the vnitie of faith with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, they haue the ſame rule of faith with the Catholike Church. <hi>p.</hi> 34. &amp; 39. For</p>
               <p>The faith of the Church is ſaid to be one, becauſe the rule of faith is one, and the ſame, from the beginning of the Church to the end. <hi>p.</hi>

               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth not, but hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21007:31"/> changed that rule of faith. <hi>p.</hi> 32. &amp; 49. For</p>
               <p>Whereas the rule of faith was ever confeſſed to be in the doctrine of the Scriptures: now in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> vnwritten traditions were taken into the rule of faith, and ſo they teach, that the whole rule is in the Scriptures, and traditions. <hi>p.</hi> 33. 49. &amp; 50.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> holdeth not the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of faith with the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>I might adde the ſeverall proofes, which this reverend Author bringeth, to proue the ſeverall parts of this argument, but I forbeare it, becauſe the principall doubt lyeth in this, that he ſaith</p>
               <p>The Scripture is the rule of faith. And</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath changd that rule.</p>
               <p>Which needeth no proofe, becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> avoucheth the ſame. <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 16. On this wiſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a rule of faith, we acknowledge it &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Scripture is an exact and abſolute rule of faith and manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pope doth diſſent from, and reiect that rule; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome things as to be beleeved againſt that rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is no leſſe, then as if he had ſaid expreſly,</p>
               <p>The Scripture is the rule of faith, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath changed it, &amp; made a word of God of their owne invention.</p>
               <p>Which are the <hi>Biſhops</hi> words in the place alledged.</p>
               <p>In that booke is ſet downe a ſecond argument for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> ſame purpoſe, thus to be framed:</p>
               <p>They that haue changed the Iudge of Controverſies of faith, haue changed that whereby the Church is knowne to be a Church.</p>
               <p>But the Church of Rome hath changed the Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21007:31"/> of faith. p. 64. &amp; 73. <hi>For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The written Word of God doth ſuffice to end all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of faith, and is the Catholike determination of the Iudge of Controverſies in faith. p. 54.</p>
               <p>They teach, that men muſt beleeue nothing, but that which the Church teacheth; by the Church they meane themſelues, who are their teachers. p. 39.</p>
               <p>They tell vs, that the rule of faith is that which the Church teacheth. p. 47. &amp; 48.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of Rome hath changed that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church is knowne to be a Church.</p>
               <p>Vnto theſe two, he bringeth a third, to this effect. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p>That Church wherein the foundation of the Church is changed, ceaſeth to be a true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But in the Church of Rome, the foundation of the church is changed.</p>
               <p>For <hi>in it</hi> the rule of faith is changed, which is the foundation of the Church. And the Church is built vpon this foundation, that is, vpon the faith contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Church of Rome ceaſeth to be a true church.</p>
               <p>Vnto this teſtimony, I may adde theſe three more. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his Verſes vpon the third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, handled in the Schooles, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. 1579. Doctor <hi>Whitaker,</hi> in his diſputations of the Church. <hi>queſt. 6. cap.</hi> 1. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Perkins,</hi> in his Prologue to the <hi>Reformed Catholike;</hi> all which doe avouch our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It may be, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> will except againſt theſe three, as incompetent to teſtifie againſt him; for of the two firſt, thus he ſaith;</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:21007:32"/>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Reynolds, all his excellencie was in his reading. Appeal. p.</hi> 123. And of Doctor <hi>Whitaker,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>he was a thorow man, and an earneſt promoter of novell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, againſt other learned Divines. Appeal. p.</hi> 71. And of them all three, that they were <hi>Puritans, delighting in contention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which, I anſwer; Theſe exceptions may truely be ſentenced by Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> in his reply vnto Maſter <hi>Hardings</hi> anſwer, the 8. <hi>Article,</hi> and the 1. diviſion, ſet downe in theſe words;</p>
               <p>He as a man overmuch obedient vnto his affections, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp his way with vnſavory and bitter talke; and as a Cocke that is well pampered with Garlick before the fight, he ſeeketh to overmatch his fellow, rather with rankneſſe of breath, then with might of body.</p>
               <p>But theſe Bookes will keepe that credit, which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> firſt given them by the principall Doctors of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Vniverſities, who allowed them for Printing, and which ſince they haue gotten by the vſe, which the Church hath had of them, which is ſufficient againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague,</hi> whoſe Bookes were no ſooner ſeene, but they had an hundred to deteſt them, for one of our Church which did like them; but moſt of all, in as much, as they proue this their ſentence, on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by an Argument vſed by the <hi>Homilie</hi> aforeſaid. <hi>p.</hi> 428.</p>
               <p>That Church whoſe faith is erronious, that muſt be avoyded.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Church whoſe faith is erronious.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be avoyded. Which argument doth convince ſo evidently, that I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21007:32"/> preſume, he will not except againſt any part thereof; but if he doe, there is ſufficient in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, beſides other where, to fortifie it againſt the ſame. Thus he writeth, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 160. &amp; 161.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is our exact and abſolute rule of faith and manners.</p>
               <p>The Pope doth diſſent from an reiect that rule, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome things as to be beleeved againſt that rule.</p>
               <p>From whence I thus argue;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that reiect the exact and abſolute rule of faith and manners, their faith is erronious.</hi> For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their faith is an aberration from the Scriptures, the rule of faith. And that aberration is error in points of faith. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. p.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But the Pope, that is, the Church of Rome, doth reiect that rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore the faith of the Church of Rome is erronious.</p>
               <p>Secondly thus;</p>
               <p>They whoſe faith diſſenteth from the rule of faith, their faith is erronius. <hi>For</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Error in points of faith, is againſt the rule of faith. Appeal. p. 7.</p>
               <p>But the faith of the Pope (that is, of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) diſſenteth from the rule of faith. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It propoſeth things as to be beleeved againſt that rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the faith of the Church of Rome is erronious.</p>
               <p>If he reply, that all this is to be vnderſtood of ſome points of faith, not of all, of ſome part of the rule, not of the whole.</p>
               <p>I rejoynd, his words are without limitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thus,</p>
               <p>The Pope doth diſſent from, and reiect the rule of faith.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21007:33"/>
               <p>And giue this for proofe, namely, in that it</p>
               <p>Propoſeth any thing as againſt that rule.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>faith is one,</hi> as himſelfe truely affirmes, <hi>Appeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 43. and the rule of faith is one, as faith it ſelfe is one. Theſe things are evident, I need not bring further proofe for them. All which being duely conſidered, I doubt not, but even M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> himſelfe will giue ſentence; That,</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a true Church.</p>
               <p>One thing more in this queſtion muſt be remembred; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Thus he writeth, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 83. This propoſition</p>
               <p>We muſt for ever vpon paine of damnation diſſent from the Church of Rome in all things, and haue no peace at all with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is a ſtrange Bugbeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, the ſence hereof muſt be firſt had, before the truth can be judged of. By <hi>Bugbeare,</hi> is meant a fiction, or pretence, vſed vnto Infants to keepe them in awe, and they are ſo vſed by the way of dalliance, becauſe Infants haue not the vſe of reaſon, and thereby are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of government by meanes that are of a higher nature, they that cannot judge of truth, nor taſte of ſubſtance, muſt be led with ſhews, and fed with fancies.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted whether this was his meaning or not, perhaps his words are extended beyond his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (may ſome man ſay) vnto whom I anſwer, he meant to ſay no leſſe then thus, and I find it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>In his Preface to the Reader before his Gagg, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beginning,</hi> he bringeth his adverſary ſaying; <hi>There is no ſalvation to Proteſtants, which he doth call ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhawe-fowle, to skare poore ſoules that haue not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie

               <p>And thus ſtands the caſe with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and theſe graue and learned men, whoſe words and proofes I haue alledged, and all other of our Church to whom they haue written in this ſentence of Maiſter <hi>Mountague.</hi> But this is an imputation more odious then humane eares can beare with Patience. What? Is our Church a dallier with her children, and that in a matter in nature ſo high? Of conſequence ſo great? Doth ſhee ſport her ſelfe, &amp; befoole her children with Gods Word and their ſalvation? Are all her children ſuch ſilly Infants, that for want of true reaſon muſt be governed by ſhadows? No marvaile though his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan fares no better, where his Mother ſpeeds ſo ill. He complaines of <hi>falſe, iniurious, vnhoneſt, fiery, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, &amp;c. Informers and Promoters.</hi> But vnder what coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, in what ranck ſhall this Champion be marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if you ſet him in the Vantgard, he will be in the enemies front before the reſt of the battell approach, if you place him in the Reare, you reſtraine his valour.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The point of Free-will, ſet downe in the former Chapter, is debated.</head>
               <p>IN this point, as in the former, three things are to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be inquired of;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether the propoſitions delivered by him be true, or not.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether thoſe propoſitions conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not.</item>
                  <item>3. Whether thoſe propoſitions diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or not.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Of the ſecond and third, we haue his ſentence in his <hi>gagg. p.</hi> 107. &amp; <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 83. where he ſaith;</p>
               <p>The particulars in this point of Free-will, controverted betweene the Church of Rome and ours, are of no great moment.</p>
               <p>And in his <hi>Appeal.</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 84. to 95. he indevours to proue; That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of Rome and our Church, doe agree in the particulars delivered by Mr</hi>: <hi>Mountague,</hi> &amp; ſet downe in the precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>To which, I anſwer, howſoever it be with our Church (for of that hereafter) from hence it doth neceſſarily follow; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He conſenteth with the Church of Rome in thoſe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> ſet downe in the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he will not deny to conſent to thoſe things, which in his judgement the Church of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth vnto.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21007:35"/> And that indeed he conſenteth fully with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will appeare by the ſight of the doctrine on both ſides, ſet downe in the Chapter going before. What it ſaith of the nature, vſe, remaining, cauſes, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working, effects, adjuncts, objects of free-will, the ſame ſaith he: he comes not ſhort one word; ſo that it ſeemeth little better, then a tranſcription out of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, and opinion, taught amongſt them.</p>
               <p>That he diſſenteth from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> labour of mine is required to ſhew it; It is his taske to ſhew his agreement therewith, for he vndertooke to defend the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt ſhew, that the doctrine which he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, is the doctrine thereof.</p>
               <p>But that he cannot doe, except he proue the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and (it ſeemes) that he himſelfe perceived ſo much, therefore he laboureth, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 84. &amp;c. to proue their conſent by this argument:</p>

               <p>Therefore there is no difference between our Church, and the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Which argument is not barely alledged; but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all due Circumſtances. Firſt (for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereof, that it might not come barely without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, he telleth vs. <hi>p.</hi> 95.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>He examined this queſtion between them and vs of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, with as great diligence as he could. p.</hi> 95.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>He thought thus before, and ſo he thinkes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>3. He confirmes the antecedent, by <hi>laying downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21007:36"/> points of free-will, maintained by ſome one that ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he calleth the moſt moderate amongst them. p.</hi> 90. and <hi>confeſt by thoſe of ours. p.</hi> 87.</item>
                  <item>4. He interprets the concluſion, and ſayth, he meanes by that <hi>Church and ours, moderate and temperate men on either ſide. p.</hi> 83.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I anſwer; If his intent be not to proue the agreement between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but between ſome profeſſors of Divinitie on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, then all his labour is in vaine: for the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ought to proue, is touching the agreement, not of private opinions in the Churches, but of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themſelues, which two differ much, as himſelfe affirmeth. <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 134. This being publike and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, that not ſo: and he profeſſeth in his Epiſtle before his <hi>Appeale, his reſolution is to leaue private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Irchius to ſhift for themſelues, and defend the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Church, publikely and vniverſally reſolved on;</hi> but according to his words alledged, that is not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, therefore all this argument is one of his <hi>Ireehius, neceſſary to be diſbanded, and ſent away to ſhift for it ſelfe, that our Mother the Church be no more troubled with it, yea, to be ſent as a vagabond to the pariſh where it laſt dwelt, not ſuffered to paſſe without due correction;</hi> and is his owne advice in his ſaid Epiſtle before his <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will ſuppoſe that he ſpeakes of the agreement of the Churches themſelues, and anſwer accordingly.</p>
               <p>The antecedent is falſe, ſome of theſe that he nameth on the part of the Church of <hi>England be ſtrangers. We are not bound vnto them; no Law directeth vs; our Church doth not compell vs to be bound vnto them,</hi> which is his owne <hi>plea, Appeal. p.</hi> 70.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:21007:36"/>
               <p>Thoſe of our Church whoſe agreement he alledgeth, are much iniured by him. It is notoriouſly falſe that he ſaith; <hi>They are as farre from agreeing with the Church of Rome in the point of free-will,</hi> as Maiſter <hi>Mountague</hi> is from—As I can and will moſt evidently declare, if need be, but there is no place for that now; for it is beſides the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is alſo falſe; theſe men you name of our church, are not the church of <hi>England,</hi> no more then one handfull is the whole harveſt; a few trees the whole Forreſt: neither is their doctrine the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>her doctrine is propoſed in Synods, confirmed by Law, commanded and eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament,</hi> as appeares by your owne deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 111.</p>
               <p>If that be ſo I yeeld: If that be not ſo, why doe you inferre our Churches agreement from their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Theſe ſores will not be healed with your owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſee your diſputation:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I examined the queſtion with diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they agree is my confirmed thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they doe agree, and that agreement is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue we done with the Vanguard, &amp; the maine battell of this diſputation, the Rere approacheth next in this order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that doe not acknowledge this agreement, 1. Doe not reade ſo much as their owne Proteſtant Writers. 2. In their Pulpits they brawle at the ſhaddow of their owne fancies. 3. Abuſe the ſimple Credulitie of the vnlearned. 4. Make themſelues ridiculous to the Papiſts. 5. Harden the Papiſts
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21007:37"/> in their ſuperſtition. 6. Miſtake ignorantly that which they doe not vnderſtand. 7. Traduce confidently and virulently. Appeal. p.</hi> 88.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I come to diſpute, therefore I will ſpeake herevnto ſo farre as it concernes the matter in hand. I liſt not to change words with him, though (perhaps) I could pay him with intereſt, therefore to the point.</p>
               <p>All thoſe heavie and bitter accuſations, are not given abſolutely, but with reference vnto, and inference vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the agreement, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of Free-will, if he hath proved that he thinkes, he may affirme theſe. Whether he hath done that or no, I will leaue to the judgement (I will not ſay) of him that is of the meaneſt capacitie, but of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> himſelfe, who muſt giue ſentence againſt his owne proofe, or els vndergoe the heavie ſentence of all men that ſhall read my anſwer. What I might anſwer to the reſt, I am not farre to ſeeke, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth tend to ſtrife, and not to edification, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hold my peace, God is the reprover of ſuch evill language, and revenger of ſuch wrongs, to whom I leaue it, and proceed to that which remaines appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this argument, which I find thus written:</p>
               <p>If you with your new learning (for old you haue little or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> none) can teach me more than yet I know, I will yeeld and thanke you for ſuch inſtructions. Appeal. p. 90.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; What is become of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting? What is become of his <hi>Logick,</hi> or where was his Caution?

               <p>2. <hi>But you cannot teach me more then yet I know.</hi> For <hi>Your learning is new, old you haue little or none. And mine is old, for the courſe of my ſtudies was never addreſſed to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Epitomizers, I went to inquire of the dayes of old, and hitherto I haue not repented me of it. Appeal. p.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore I will not yeeld &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may diſpute alſo from hence, a third way: Thus</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. But you can teach me more than yet I know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore I will yeeld and thanke you for ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he will diſpute the firſt way, the Syllogiſme is true: but every boy in the Schools will laugh at him, for the aſſumption is folly, and the conſequence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is madneſſe, no man (well in his wits) would ſay, <hi>I will not yeeld, therefore you cannot teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he diſputeth in the ſecond manner, his Syllogiſme is falſe, and concludes nothing; every poore Sophiſter knows that. But in this manner he muſt be vnderſtood, for his proofes doe lie directly for the confirmation of this aſſumption, and cannot otherwiſe be applyed.</p>
               <p>But let it be as he will (for the forme) the aſſumption is a blaſt of vaine-glory, the anſwer is readie; <hi>Let him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21007:38"/> that putteth off his armour boaſt, and not he that putteth it on.</hi> If you had lead <hi>Cauſabon</hi> in triumph, I would haue adviſed you to <hi>brag of glory, and ſtay at home:</hi> but becauſe you haue not, I come not ſo farre.</p>
               <p>The confirmation of your aſſumption, is an apple of the ſame tree: but (the beſt is) if you touch it, it falls to powder. But I pray, tell me, how doe you know all their learning is new, haue they no bookes of the old? Haue they no guts in their braines, to make vſe of ſuch bookes? no tongues in their heads to impart their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to others? Or doe you know, they haue none by any ſpeciall teſtimony from their own mouths, or your owne illumination? Is it true indeed, is your learning all old? Haue you ingroſt all the books thereof? Does wit keepe her Common-wealth in your breaſt? Then happie man are you; but thrice vnhappie the world, from whom the old learning is ſequeſtred, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a corner, yea into a cloſe corner, out of which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get (I am ſure yet it hath not gotten.) I might goe on, to ſhew the inſufficiency (if not folly) of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, of your Aſſumption; but I proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>If you will diſpute in the third ſort, you make a true Syllogiſme, but then behold your ſtaydnes (a man of confirmed reſolution I will warrant you.) He change? no ſuch matter, even now you found him triumphing in the victory: now you find him Capitulating vpon conditions of peace. Even now you found him inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over his captivated adverſary: now you ſee him creeping and fawning vnto him over whom he inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and doe you know what manner of one he is, to whom he ſpeaketh? If you doe not, he will tell you,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21007:38"/> and you muſt beleeue him, for old learning cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you: this he is, <hi>A poore Divine, ſhort ſighted, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly travelled. He knowes Fenners divinitie, if you put him out of that, he is as blind as a Beetle &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howſoever the game goeth, this he ſaith (and tie him to his word, you ſhall find him either better or worſe then you make of him)</p>
               <p>If you will teach me, I will yeeld and thanke you too.</p>
               <p>And becauſe you ſhall ſee he is not in jeſt, he repeats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his promiſe againe, with an addition, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 95. in theſe words;</p>
               <p>If you can make it appeare, that there is any ſuch materiall difference between the Church of Rome (in the point of free-will) and the Church of England, then I will turne over a new leafe, euen in this Article oppoſing the church of Rome as farre as any &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; it muſt be here obſerved, that he confeſſeth his agreement with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> els vnto what can he yeeld? What leafe can he turne over? How can he oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this <hi>Article</hi> of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, more then he does now? So that he cannot here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after deny that he agrees with it in this point of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</p>

               <p>The point of <hi>Free-will</hi> in queſtion, concerneth the 8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> propoſition, the reaſon of the doubt ariſeth thus;</p>

               </p>
               <p>This doubt, both the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> with it doe reſolue, by the doctrine delivered by them both, ſet downe in the precedent Chapter, on this manner;</p>

               <p>The will doth aſſent, conſent, and determine &amp;c. of it ſelfe, out of that inbred libertie, which is in the will it ſelfe: and this libertie conſiſteth 1. in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and indeterminatenes vnto doing or not doing, to the doing of this, or the contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.

               <p>That their doctrine ſet downe (as is before ſaid) doth yeeld this anſwer, they that are acquainted with the writings of the learned in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with me: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It may be, ſome will deſire to know the reaſon why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the <hi>Councel of Trent,</hi> did ſatisfie this doubt by decreeing the nature or qualitie of the aſſent; and not the root or fountaine from whence that aſſent did flow and ariſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this queſtion is not demanded without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the Decree of the <hi>Councell</hi> doth reſolue the doubt by conſequence, and not immediately, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by goeth (as it may ſeeme) a way which is farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and more obſcure. To ſatisfie the demand is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. 1. The nature of the thing it ſelfe required that courſe, for the faculties themſelues of mans ſoule, are ſo farre removed from our knowledge, that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they cannot be judged of: But all the knowledge we haue of them, is by the effects which doe flow from them,</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:21007:41"/>
               <p>Againe, the courſe of the divine Revelation required it, for it is ſilent &amp; ſaith nothing of the facultie it ſelfe: but ſaith enough (at leaſt as they ſuppoſe) touching the act. And this it ſeemeth was the reaſon of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; for in the fift Chapter of that ſixt ſeſſion, it ſayth theſe words; <hi>Turne vnto me, doe admoniſh vs of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Where it doth argue, the nature of the facultie, by the nature and qualitie of the act of the will.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Councell</hi> doth not indeed and in the thing, take that way which is more obſcure, but rather that which is more cleare and more certain. For the nature and qualitie of the act doth argue, &amp; ſet out the nature and qualitie of the facultie, from whence it floweth by neceſſary inference and abſolute certaintie. A neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect, cannot flow but from a neceſſary facultie. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man will grant, the neceſſitie that is in the ſight of the eye (when all circumſtances doe concurre) can ariſe from no other facultie, but ſuch as is determined and neceſſitated vnto ſeing. The eye ſeeth the viſible object (and cannot chooſe but ſee it) where all other circumſtances doe concurre, becauſe the eye it ſelfe, or facultie of ſight by creation is apted, fitted, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto ſeing, and hath not in its libertie to ſee or not ſee, when a viſible thing is obiected thereunto, and all other circumſtances doe concurre. The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe actions which proceed from their next efficient cauſe, contingently and freely. Of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will ſay, I did this with that freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that at the very moment when I begun to do it, and alwayes before, it was in my power not to haue done it, or to haue done the contrary therunto. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the facultie from whence this act floweth by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21007:42"/> is not apted, fitted, or neceſſitated vnto the doing of actions of this kind, and reſtrained from actions of all other kinds. But in it ſelfe is indetermined vnto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any kind, remaineth indifferent vnto doing or not doing, to the doing of this, or the contrary. Hath dominion over actions of every kind, to doe or not doe; to the doing of this or the contrary, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth without the reſtraint or guidance of any ſuperior, extrinſecall, or previall worker, leading and limiting the ſame vnto this, rather then vnto that. In ſo much, as if mans action of conſenting &amp;c. had beene ſo free, as the <hi>Councell</hi> hath decreed it to be, then it is moſt true that it had firſt proceeded from a facultie no leſſe free. Thus much ſhall ſuffice, to ſet downe the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> touching this point.</p>

               <p>From whence doth follow, that in his judgement mans will it ſelfe is the firſt roote or foundation of our ſupernaturall conſent.</p>
               <p>If he anſwer, he <hi>giveth to grace the power of ſuſtaining and vpholding. Appeal. p.</hi> 94. I reply, this helpeth not the matter, for to ſuſtaine, is onely to preſerue man in his being, and alſo it belongeth to Gods generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he doth ſo to all creatures; but we ſpeake of his ſpeciall providence, ordering man vnto eternall life.

The onely difference lyeth in the doubt propounded, <hi>num.</hi> 7. and in the libertie of mans will, taught by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as aforeſaid, for the reſolving of that doubt.</p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſatisfieth that doubt, on this wiſe;</p>
               <p>The Predeſtinate to life, be called by Gods ſpirit. They through grace obey that calling. Arti: 17. vnto which it doth diſpoſe them. <hi>Homilie,</hi> pag. 456.</p>
               <p>Which is all one, as if it had ſaid;</p>
               <p>They through grace, and the diſpoſing thereof, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, reſolue, determine, &amp;c. to beleeue, feare, hope, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For thereunto by grace, or Gods ſpirit, is man called and diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>In which is alſo implyed; that,</p>
               <p>The eliciated act of Conſenting &amp;c. is not free: man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the inſtant of eliciating that act, reiect grace, and diſſent from the Calling thereof.</p>
               <p>Which ſentence, is inferred on this wiſe;</p>
               <p>Every act ſo wrought by Gods ſpirit, as mans will

               <p>The operation of grace, or Gods ſpirit, is determined to one.</p>
               <p>But mans conſenting, which is obedience to the call of grace, &amp;c. is an Act ſo wrought by Gods grace. So ſayth the <hi>Article</hi> and <hi>Homilie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the act of conſenting is not free.</p>
               <p>What it doth giue to mans will; our Church giueth to grace: that act which it maketh free; our Church maketh neceſſary.</p>
               <p>In this doctrine and inference therefrom, the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> doth directly oppoſe the faith of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſuch expreſſe and manifeſt ſort, as hereafter there can no doubt be made, whether it doth diſſent therefrom or no, or wherein that diſſent ſhould lie; ſo that now nothing remaineth, but that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> ſhould oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to his promiſe, ſet downe <hi>num.</hi> 5. But (me-thinkes) I heare him ſay, this <hi>difference</hi> is not <hi>materiall,</hi> it importeth not any thing worthy of difference and diſſent, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from minds <hi>tranſported with faction,</hi> therefore I am not yet tyed vnto that promiſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; he ſeemeth indeed to attribute the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and oppoſition to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point of free-will, to ariſe from no other ground, but <hi>faction, Appeal p.</hi> 84. &amp;c. But altogether vntruly, for the Church of <hi>England</hi> holdeth not a <hi>faction</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but hath made a <hi>ſeparation</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of damnation, as hath beene declared, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 6. <hi>num.</hi> 6. Neither was ſhee ſo ignorant, as to take a ſhadow in ſtead of a ſubſtance, nor of ſuch an idle head
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21007:44"/> ſolemnly to determine and decree matters of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be matter of faith. But if any man ſhould be of that ill mind, that in any thing he could thinke ſo of her; yet in this point he could not doe ſo; for this faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is erroneous, therefore for it alone (let the matter it ſelfe be what it will be) muſt ſhee be oppoſed to the vttermoſt; becauſe ſuch a faith is an addition vnto the Word of God, threatned to be puniſhed by eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>The matter it ſelfe is alſo of great moment in it ſelfe. Our Church doth giue all the honour of our ſalvation (in the event &amp; in the manner of working) vnto God; theirs doth devide it between God and man, and giues onely this honour to God, that he maketh man 1. able to begin to tread in the way vnto ſalvation; and 2. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes mans defects, and joynes with him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe it ſelfe: but he leaveth vnto man and the inbred libertie, that is in the created facultie of his will, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and produce the firſt act, or to make voyd the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and poſſibilitie alreadie wrought by grace, and to prevent, reiect, and foreſtall the offer and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſecond ſupply and power of grace, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating both the firſt and ſecond worke of grace. If man will conſent vnto, &amp; obey the firſt worke of grace, then the ſecond does joyne with him, and therupon he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on indeed in the way to heaven. If man refuſeth to conſent vnto, and obey the firſt worke of grace, then the whole worke thereof ceaſeth &amp; comes to nothing, and the work of the ſecond grace never commeth on; beginneth not at all.</p>
               <p>The worke of mans ſalvation ceaſeth, he is where he was, as if grace had never wrought vpon him. Now
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21007:44"/> that this is iniurious vnto God, is ſo manifeſt that it needs not be proved, ſeeing the greateſt ſhare of mans abilitie, to doe thoſe things that ſhall lead him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is given to man himſelfe: the leſſer vnto God. That man may be ſaved, it is of God, who beginneth and joyneth with man, vnto the doing of that which he could not doe of himſelfe. But that this power is brought vnto act, is attributed to man himſelfe, and the onely libertie of his own will. Grace doth nothing by any effectuall efficiency vpon the will, determining the ſame to God, or reſtraining it from the contrary.</p>
               <p>To conclude; ſeeing that I haue performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of your promiſe at <hi>num. 5.

               <p>The firſt of them, begins thus;</p>
               <p>Free-will is in vs ſubſiſting, not in Title onely.</p>
               <p>This propoſition in the termes wherein it lyeth is true, for by the facultie of the will, and the electiue and free power thereof, man is really diſtinguiſhed from all other creatures. What ſhall be ſaid to it in his ſence, ſhall be declared, <hi>num.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, beginneth thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
               </p>
               <p>Free-will is a power &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:21007:45"/>
               <p>The firſt branch of this deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>free-will</hi> is true, and cannot be denyed. The ſecond branch that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it in a facultie of doing freely, and in an abſolute dominion over his own actions &amp;c. is vtterly denyed, by reaſon he is not able to proue it. He beſtirres him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to proue the firſt branch of his deſcription, or the firſt propoſition (according as he will be vnderſtood) by experience, and the authoritie of <hi>Scot. Appeal. p.</hi> 99. But of this ſecond branch, he hath not a word, which argues he can bring none for it, ſeeing this doth need it more then that. Secondly, if man hath this freedome and dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then God hath leſſe charge, providence, and government over the actions of men, then over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other created effects; for in them God is the onely principall efficient of the worke: they are inſtruments to worke in ſubordination vnto, and by the force of him. But man is hereby made a principall efficient of his workes; ſuperior, or (at leaſt) equall vnto God by giving vnto him freedome, and abſolute dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelfe, to doe as he will.</p>
               <p>God made man, and gaue him his being, he yeeldeth him his concourſe, whereby he doth ſuſtaine him in his being. All this while God is no efficient of mans actions, except very remotely. Man by his being hath a dominion over himſelfe, and freedome to doe as he will, hereby he is an efficient next and principall vnto his owne actions, if not the onely efficient; for mans actions haue relation to the force of man in the doing of them, but they haue no relation vnto God at all. The effect may ſay, by mans power I had my being, and by Gods power man had his being. But it may not be granted, that God hath no providence over mans
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21007:45"/> actions, or leſſe providence then over the actions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; for the Scripture is plaine, and full to the contrary. Thirdly, there is no neceſſitie why this freedome and dominion ſhould be given to the will, for as much as the properties given to the will, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the deſcription, is enough to make it a free facultie. Which I ſay not of my ſelfe: I learne it from <hi>Suarez. opuſc. 1. cap. 1. num.</hi> 2. And he ſayth, that many graue and ancient Divines, yea, <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſome of the Fathers are of that Iudgement. At leaſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent himſelfe with that libertie of the will, and not to ſtriue for this dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth forbeare to call that by the name of <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> leaſt it ſhould agree in manner of ſpeaking with the hereticks of this time; as <hi>Suarez</hi> avoucheth in the place laſt alledged.</p>
               <p>The third propoſition, hath theſe words; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
               </p>
               <p>That libertie was &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; If by <hi>libertie</hi> you meane the vſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in ſupernaturall actions, then the propoſition is falſe; for, <hi>man by ſinne loſt grace,</hi> as you truely teach, <hi>gagg. p.</hi> 108. And without grace, mans will is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing ſupernaturall actions, which <hi>for their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, firſt, and ſpecificall nature, are beyond the abilitie of the force of the Created facultie,</hi> and which <hi>cannot be done without the grace of God,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> teacheth. <hi>opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 1. num.</hi> 1. 2. 3. And proveth, <hi>cap. 15. num.</hi> 20. And in this ſence, we muſt vnderſtand thoſe Divines which teach the loſſe of <hi>free-will</hi> by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. Therefore the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> (and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> with it) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their owne ſhadow, when they decreed as againſt an adverſary, when indeed they had none. Which is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21007:46"/> further confirmed thus; If <hi>libertie</hi> be taken to ſignifie <hi>the facultie it ſelfe,</hi> then that third propoſition is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that vpon the ſame reaſon himſelfe alledgeth out of the <hi>Councell of Trent, gagg. p. 108. Adam by ſinne loſt not his nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth, fift, and ſixt propoſitions, containe thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> much;</p>
               <p>Mans free facultie, and the free vſe thereof, is in him that hath grace.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; the free facultie and grace are both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one man, and ſo farre this propoſition is true. 2. If the vſe of that free facultie be committed, vnto the dominion and diſpoſe of the will it ſelfe: then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe. It can never be proved, that the vſe of the free facultie of the will is left vnto the diſpoſe and dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the will it ſelfe, but the dominion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereof, is reſerved vnto the Lord God: and he ſayth no leſſe, when he promiſed to <hi>take away the ſtony heart, and giue a heart of fleſh, and to imprint his lawes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> ſhew, where God ſaith to a man prevented by grace, I haue made thee able to doe holy workes if thou wilt. I commit thy ſelfe vnto thy ſelfe, goe forward or backward as thou wilt; there I will reſt, I will take no further care of thee, nor haue no further command over thee; but this cannot be done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may conclude, the propoſition thus vnderſtood (and ſo he doth vnderſtand it) is falſe.</p>
               <p>But if the vſe of the free facultie, be committed vnto the Lord God, to diſpoſe of as he pleaſe, ſo as mans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto grace that calleth, be given to grace (as the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Arti:</hi> 17.) and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of mans nature be vſed by grace onely, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21007:46"/> thereunto, then I grant this propoſition is true. The vſe of the free facultie is in him which hath grace. But in this ſence he cannot vnderſtand it; for then mans actions cannot be ſo free, as he pretendeth in the ſeventh and eighth propoſitions following.</p>
               <p>In this ſence, <hi>free-will</hi> is <hi>meerly titular,</hi> having a name without the thing, as we vſe to ſpeake when a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth a thing, but hath no vſe of it; and in this ſence, our Divines haue ſayd true, who affirme mans freewill is in title onely; ſo alſo is it moſt truly affirmed of them that ſay, mans will <hi>is a ſerving, not a free-will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh and eight propoſition, containeth thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> much;</p>
               <p>He that aſſenteth &amp;c. aſſenteth freely, and can deny his aſſent if he will &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>can,</hi> in this propoſition, doth ſignifie <hi>a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of vſing the free facultie with indifferency, in the very inſtant in which a man doth worke;</hi> and ſo <hi>Suarez</hi> doth vnderſtand it, <hi>opuſc. 1. lib. 1. cap. 1. num.</hi> 8. And ſo muſt the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> be vnderſtood, <hi>ſeſſ. 6. cap.</hi> 5. For all other ſenſes thereof, are violent and extorted, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the phraſe vſed by the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> nor their intent in decreeing.</p>
               <p>If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Mountague</hi> can proue this, let him take all for me. I will not oppoſe the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> and himſelfe (a Diſciple thereof) in this queſtion of <hi>free-will.</hi> If he cannot proue it, why doth he put himſelfe into Gods ſeat, by intruding and vrging <hi>Articles</hi> of faith. I am out of doubt, he cannot proue it; for <hi>Suarez</hi> hath attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many things, and heau'd at it with both his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but all in vaine, it may be, <hi>Suarez</hi> hath <hi>no old lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> nor <hi>Logick ſo good as Ramus taught in Cambridge,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:21007:47"/> no Metaphyſicks at all, but is ignorant in this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Thus he diſputeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Mathew 23. and 37. there is an oppoſition of mans wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe vnto Gods will, God would, Iudah would not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore freely men renounce the Calling of grace, and freely runne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; the laſt branch of the concluſion, which ſpeaketh of <hi>running</hi> with Gods grace, cannot follow vpon the Antecedent, becauſe mans will in ſinfull acts is an efficient after a different ſort, and in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then it is in ſupernaturall actions. <hi>In them it is a principall efficient (that is, ſinneth of it ſelfe) in theſe it is a ſubordinate efficient,</hi> as your ſelfe teach, <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 94. therefore ſinne doth flow from the will one wayes, and ſupernaturall actions another.</p>
               <p>The firſt branch in the concluſion doth not follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> vpon the Antecedent, which hath not a word of <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, libertie, or dominion in reſiſting,</hi> but barely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with the eliciated <hi>act of reſiſting.</hi> If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that reſiſting is an act of the will, and every act of the will hath that freedome and dominion.

               <p>Therefore it comes too late to take away my anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Antecedent by the word <hi>Call,</hi> doth vnderſtand the Calling of God, and the inward calling by grace, otherwiſe there can be no ſhew of goodneſſe in the

               <p>You reſiſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>In this argument he raiſeth his confidence, becauſe the very word <hi>reſiſt</hi> is vſed there. I anſwer; a poore foundation for confidence. It hath the ſame fault the former had: it affirmeth of reſiſting ſimply; our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of freedome in reſiſting, ſo it is nothing to the purpoſe. You vnderſtand it of the work of grace in the ſoule, but you proue it not: it may be vnderſtood of their reſiſting of the outward Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, therefore we haue your owne authoritie, and no more; we haue no reaſon to thinke that God inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned &amp;c. all theſe perſons that are ſayd <hi>to reſiſt the holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But in a man regenerate, there is concupiſcence.</hi>

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:21007:48"/>
               <p>I anſwer; This concluſion is nothing to the purpoſe; for our queſtion is of the preparation vnto the habit and freedome in reſiſting; but this concluſion is of a man habituated, and of reſiſting ſimply.</p>
               <p>If it be vnderſtood of reſiſting freely, then the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is falſe. For Concupiſcence hath nothing to doe with freedome of will: this is a perfection given by Creation; that is a defection procured by ſinne.</p>
               <p>His laſt Argument, is in theſe words; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>If a man iuſtified, may fall away from grace, then he may reſiſt the grace of God offered.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; this concluſion hath the very ſame fault which the former had. Beſides, it ſayth <hi>grace is offered</hi> to a juſtified man, how that can be true, himſelfe muſt declare; for a juſtified man hath grace already, vnto ſuch a man grace cannot be offered.</p>

               <p>It ſeemes he perceived thus much: therfore in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. p.</hi> 91. &amp; 94. he labours to cure that vlcer, by ſaying</p>
               <p>Supernaturall actions, are true and reall operations of mans ſoule, but the ſoule is elevated &amp; actuated to that height by grace, of which it is, that mans will is a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate agent vnto grace.</p>
               <p>Which declaration comes very ſhort, therefore I will adde a paſſage in <hi>Suarez,</hi> which doth expreſſe the ſame thing more fully, in his <hi>opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 15. num.</hi> 20. he writeth thus;</p>
               <p>Mans will cannot haue any connaturall power, which by its nature is a worker of a ſupernaturall act, either as a totall or partiall cauſe, but when the creature doth ſo worke, it worketh as an inſtrument of God, &amp; although it worketh by his owne entitie, yet notwithſtanding, not out of a force naturall, but obedientall.</p>
               <p>This addition I make by his owne authoritie, for he doth profeſſe in his <hi>Appeal. p.</hi> 90. that he takes the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid explication from <hi>Pontificians.</hi> I anſwer; All this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might haue beene ſpared, becauſe it helpeth the matter nothing at all. It makes it more obſcure then before. Every man can vnderſtand what you meane, when you ſay, the will doth worke by <hi>the naturall force,</hi> but when you ſay, the entitie of the will doth worke by a <hi>ſupernaturall force, elevation, and actuation,</hi> he will be to ſeeke of your meaning. Moreover, this explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth take away the free vſe of the free facultie, which you contend for, or leaue mans will to worke, by the naturall force of the created facultie, which is the thing you would thruſt off; and I ſhew it thus: This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation and actuation, if by grace, is either a morall or a phyſicall worke; if phyſicall, then the will is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined vnto one: the free vſe of the facultie is abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21007:49"/> and reſtrained; for this worke of grace is previall in nature and cauſalitie, and truely efficient vpon the will, before it be applyed vnto operation in the ſecond act. If it be morall, then the will doth worke of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall force therof, becauſe the morall worke of grace, is no more but a perſwaſion offered to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and reſteth there. It hath no influence vnto, nor reflection vpon the will, which is vncapable of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of truth and falſhood: onely it cannot will any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but that which the vnderſtanding ſayth is good, which connexion between the vnderſtanding and the will, is naturall, no worke of grace. To conclude, two propoſitions may be inferred from this explication.</p>

It maketh remiſſion of ſinnes one thing, he another; as ſhall bee ſhewed hereafter <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 26. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all which euidence, he laboureth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in his <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 168. and 188. to perſwade the world; that,</p>
               <p>He conſenteth not with the Church of Rome, nor diſſenteth from the Church of England.</p>
               <p>But all his labour is in vaine, the contradictory will proue true, as this diſcourſe will declare.</p>
               <p>He pleadeth for himſelfe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>by grace infuſed hee meant and intended onely concommitanter, that is, grace concurreth with remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins in a iuſtified man, pag. 168. 169. &amp;</hi> 170.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in that deſcription hee went not punctually to worke, but deſcribed Iuſtification at large, for that act of God of remiſsion of ſins, and the neceſſary and immediate concomitance vnto, and conſequence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21007:51"/> that.</hi> Appeale, pag. 172. 178.</p>
               <p>He chargeth ſuch as do not vnderſtand that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in this ſenſe, with <hi>ignorant or wilfull miſtaking his meaning, or obſtinate refuſall of ſatisfaction.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, pag. 168. 172.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; All this is a faire ſhew put vpon a foule cauſe, a meere pretence without ſhew of truth. I will make it appeare, firſt by my anſwers to the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he brings to proue hee meant thus. And then by proofes from the things themſelues. This was not his intent, but his words muſt be vnderſtood as they lie without interpretation.</p>
               <p>His firſt argument, <hi>p.</hi> 168. is to this effect. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I did attribute grace infuſed to Iuſtification ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded grace infuſed is in a iuſtified man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; This reaſon is reaſonleſſe: There is no ſhew in the Conſequence, the word <hi>ſecondarily</hi> cannot lead your Reader to thinke you meant ſo, neither doe you ſhew how it ſhould.</p>
               <p>Againe, your owne words doe proue you meant not that, by the word <hi>ſecondarily:</hi> but that grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed doth conſtitute Iuſtification in a ſecond notion: For if Iuſtification be a motion between two termes, the one of ſinne wherein a man was; the other of grace whereto a man is brought, and that is the firſt, this the ſecond, then grace doth conſtitute Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a ſecond notion; but you teach the firſt, <hi>Gagge, pag.</hi> 143. and 141. therefore you muſt be vnderſtood to meane the laſt.</p>
               <p>In the next place he telleth vs; that <hi>his purpoſe was to let the Papiſt know that we taught, that a man iuſtified is ſanctified alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:21007:52"/>
               <p>I anſwer; This proueth not that hee meant to ſay that grace infuſed is in a man that is iuſtified, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that he did meane ſo, and ſheweth why hee did meane ſo, therefore it is nothing to the purpoſe. Beſides, it is vtterly falſe, he had no purpoſe to ſay any ſuch thing; for the queſtion then in hand, was whether <hi>faith only doth iuſtifie:</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> could not yeeld him any occaſion to ſay <hi>Grace was in a iuſtified man,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two things euery way diſtinct and without the ſhew of affinity. Againe, neuer any Papiſt liuing did write or ſay that we denie a iuſtified man to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alſo, therefore you had no occaſion thus to ſay.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, <hi>pag.</hi> 171. he hath theſe words, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p>If a iuſtified man bee alſo ſanctified, then might I allow one common word to containe &amp; expreſſe both the parts.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; 1. This ſuppoſeth he meant as hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, &amp; ſheweth the reaſon why hee comprehended two things diſtinct in nature vnder one name; but proues not that hee meant to ſay as hee pretendeth. 2. He beſtoweth much labour, and ſpares for no coſt to proue the firſt part of this reaſon, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for that was neuer denyed by any man in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor in any other Church that ioyneth in faith with it. But the conſequence is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, for theſe two parts are not eſſentiall vnto that whole which you call Iuſtification. Therefore when you make one word to containe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is vntrue, diſagreeable to art, and a monſter in nature. He is vnskilfull that puts a childs-ſhooe vpon the foot of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that addeth to the ſtatue of a man the limmes of a beaſt, and iuſt ſo doe you in this place, if you comprehend remiſſion of ſins and ſanctification
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21007:52"/> vnder the name of Iuſtification. And this is his whole plea touching the firſt part of his excuſe, (and this too much too) for of three things two of them are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſides the matter, and voyd of truth in themſelues, the third diſproued by his owne plaine teſtimony.</p>
               <p>In the behalfe of the ſecond part of his excuſe, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſaith, page 172.</p>
               <p>Iuſtification is taken in Scripture ſtrictly for remiſsion of ſinnes, and largely for that act of God, and the neceſſary, &amp; immediate concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto, and conſequence vpon that, &amp;c, and the like doth Caluine, Perkins, Beza.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; This ſuppoſeth that he did deſcribe Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication largely, when hee ſaid, <hi>Iuſtification conſiſteth in remiſsion of ſinnes, and grace infuſed,</hi> but proues it not: therefore it is nothing to the purpoſe. But let it be ſuppoſed, he can proue it at ſome other time, and goe on with him to examine what he bringeth: I ſay it is vtterly falſe, the Scripture doth neuer take the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a ſinner any other wayes but one; you bring no proofe that it doth, &amp; your word is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: when your proofs come, you ſhal haue anſwer: for the authority of <hi>Caluin,</hi> &amp;c. I need not much weigh in this queſtion, becauſe I know your ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it worth nothing. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith no ſuch thing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The laſt thing he pretendeth is, that</p>
               <p>His intent was to confute the Gagger.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; This hath no force to proue, that</p>
               <p>Therefore I deſcribed Iuſtification, as comprehending Sanctification, when I ſaid it conſiſteth in remiſsion of ſinnes, and grace infuſed.</p>
               <p>For ſo to deſcribe it, is not the way the confute, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21007:53"/> to be confuted: firſt, becauſe that deſcription is falſe: ſecondly, in it you agree with the Gagger in an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his Faith, decreed by the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, your antecedent is falſe: you had no ſuch intent: For the thing to be refuted, was <hi>Faith onely doth not iuſtifie,</hi> ſo ſaith your aduerſary, which you might haue refuted without relation to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Iuſtification; for he muſt proue (at leaſt) that ſomthing elſe beſides Faith doth concur to Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or confeſſe he ſayd not truely. It was not required on your part to proue all other things were excluded; therefore there was no need or occaſion of making a deſcription of Iuſtification. But ſuppoſe there had beene good reaſon why you ſhould haue made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Iuſtification, yet the making of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, doth argue your intent was not to refute the Gagger, but to eſtabliſh and confirme the Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers poſition; for if Iuſtification bee as you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, then without all doubt, more things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Iuſtification beſides Faith: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth diſpute iuſt after the ſame manner, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 18. Laſtly, vpon this deſcription of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you proceed, and ſay, man is the <hi>ſubiect</hi> thereof, and that thereunto there are <hi>required certaine prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to the purpoſe;</hi> the firſt wherof you ſay is <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his Law,</hi> &amp;c. that is indeed aſſent vnto the Law of God, which is Faith, according to the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> for you doe not ſpeake of ſuch a knowledge of the Law, which is without an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the truth thereof. You proceed, and teach that <hi>Faith is the roote and originall of the reſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations:</hi> iuſt as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> doth, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21007:53"/> proues your intent was to iuſtifie, and not to refute your aduerſaries poſition.</p>
               <p>If notwithſtanding all this, you will ſtill affirme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> your meaning to be ſuch, as is ſet downe <hi>no.</hi> 4. and plead your owne authority for the proofe thereof (as beſt able to declare what you meant) then firſt your meaning is not expreſt by your words: ſecondly, the whole courſe of your Doctrine ſaith one thing, and your intent is another: thirdly, your meaning was without reaſon to guide it: fourthly, the Doctrine that caryeth your meaning, doth deſtroy what you meant to build: but you will deny all theſe foure, therefore you muſt confeſſe you had no ſuch intent.</p>
               <p>After he hath thus declared what his intent was in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> this deſcription, he goeth on, <hi>pag.</hi> 174. to ſhew what his intent is touching the nature and adequate being of Iuſtification, which hee proclaimeth in theſe words;</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be it knowne vnto you; that, I beleeue</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuſtification is (in ſtrictneſſe of termes: Not regeneration, nor renouation, nor ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A certaine action in God, applyed vnto vs:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or, A certaine reſpect, or relation,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereby wee are pardoned and acquitted of our ſinnes,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſteemed righteous before God; And</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Accepted by him in Chriſt vnto life euerlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>I anſwere; If this proclamation had been publiſhed by an authority ſufficient to compell vs to haue aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, then had it beene poſſible, that you had giuen ſatisfaction: but for want of that, you muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21007:54"/> giue vs leaue to touch, to handle, to ſearch, before we take. Thus therefore I proceed:</p>
               <p>This great adoe is about nothing: you tell vs now what you doe beleeue when you writ your ſecond Booke. Wee inquire what beleefe you did expreſſe by your writing in your firſt Booke. Let this fault be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, we will reſt ſatisfied with this, if there be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe why, but alacke there is no ſuch matter. And thus I ſhew it:</p>
               <p>You did not beleeue that Iuſtification is as now you pretend, for if you had ſo beleeued, you would haue expreſſed that beleefe, becauſe your intent was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Gagger, as you profeſſe. <hi>Appeale page</hi> 173. Now this beleefe had been an eaſie and ready way to haue refuted him, ſeeing that the queſtion there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted was, whether,</p>
               <p>A man is Iuſtified by Faith onely:</p>
               <p>As is euident by the 18. Chapter of your firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Booke; and it would neceſſarily follow: That a man is iuſtified by faith onely, if Iuſtification bee as you now deſcribe it: which I take as granted without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by implicaiton, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no leſſe, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 1. cap. 18. Adde quod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if you had then beleeued Iuſtification is as you deſcribe it now, then your thoughts in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood would haue now beene orderly digeſted: but here is nothing but confuſedneſſe, and thus I ſhew it:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, you deſcribe by a negatiue, which Art for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, you place the <hi>Genus</hi> in two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>action.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>reſpect, or relation.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If you would expreſſe one thing by thoſe diſtinct
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21007:54"/> termes, then you intend a thing impoſſible: for an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is an em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nation from a worker, Reſpect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (as it is here vſed) importeth an adiunct vnto a ſubiect. If your meaning bee, to expreſſe two things diſtinct in nature, by theſe diſtinct termes, then you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deſcription is ridiculous: I need not ſhew how.</p>
               <p>3 You ſay it is an <hi>action in God,</hi> which ſignifieth an action immanent, which is falſe; Iuſtification is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tranſient, and your ſelfe confeſſe it, when you ſay, <hi>Iuſtification is by Faith, and made in an inſtant,</hi> G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gge page 146. which doe import actions wrought vpon the creatures in time. You alſo tell vs, this <hi>action i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> applyed vnto vs,</hi> which ſignifies an action tranſient, which is contrary to the former; and ſo you ſay, and vnſay, with one breath.</p>
               <p>4 You ſay, <hi>pardon of ſinnes is by a reſpect or relation in God.</hi> Which ſentence is wholly without ſenſe, For <hi>reſpect, or relation,</hi> hath not any force, by which an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhould be produced; neither can it bee conceiued what you meane by Reſpect, or Relation, or how pardon of ſinnes, ſhould flow from, or depend vpon, that Reſpect or Relation. And ſo much for the <hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 You place the ſpeciall nature of Iuſtification in three things, viz. Firſt, Remiſſion of ſinnes: ſecondly, Eſteeming righteous: thirdly, Accepting to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as vntruly, and vnreaſonably, as the former: for theſe three are really diſtinct; and, therefore cannot concurre ioyntly together vnto the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and formall being of Iuſtification. Indeede <hi>eſteeming righteous</hi> is an act of GODS vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and called Intuitiue knowledge, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the thing already in being. <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21007:55"/> act of Gods will, from whence it receiueth being. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation to life,</hi> ſignifies an act of God willing eternall life vnto man, (as <hi>Vaſquez</hi> hath truely obſerued:) which belongs to Predeſtination, and not to Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? Laſtly, Iuſtification is a motion from one poſitiue to another. But Eſteeming righteous, and Accepting to life, is not ſuch: therefore not eſſentiall to Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>He doth father this confuſedneſſe vpon other men, and expreſly nameth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> for one, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 174. but it will not excuſe him: for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> writ a comment (as himſelfe there alledgeth) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was meet for him to vſe amplifications for cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vnmeet to be tyed vnto the exact vſe of Art: becauſe that is obſcure: but <hi>Mountagu</hi> is a Diſputer, and therefore muſt auoid ſtragling. Beſides, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> deſpiſeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> with no ſmall degree of ſcorne, as is manifeſt by what he writeth of him in his <hi>Appeale page</hi> 270. therefore it is plaine, in this deſcription he was not guided by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Wee may conclude this Deſcription is his owne, it hath not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> for ſhelter.</p>
               <p>6 Thoſe ſuperfluities being pared off, your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is this;</p>
               <p>Iuſtification is remiſsion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>You doe not beleeue, that, <hi>Iuſtification is remiſsion of ſinnes;</hi> for if you doe, then doe you not beleeue, that there is an <hi>increaſe and augmentation of Iuſtification by the increaſe and acceſſe of Gods grace:</hi> for remiſſion of ſinnes admits no increaſe, and augmentation, much leſſe by a new acceſſe of Gods grace, which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Sanctification, and not to Iuſtification. But
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21007:55"/> you doe beleeue the conſequent, and doe profeſſe it in your <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 168. 169.</p>
               <p>If it be anſwered, <hi>remiſsion of ſinnes is increaſed by daily receiuing remiſsion of new ſinnes, and by increaſe of grace, and good deedes,</hi> viz. <hi>by declaring him to bee iuſt, that is already made iuſt.</hi> In which ſort hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 162. 169. 197. I reply, this anſwer doth not take away the force of my argument; for it is auowed onely vpon his owne word, hee doth not proue it to bee ſo, nor ſhew how it can bee thus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be very great need of both; for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes doth take away the very being of ſinne that is paſt, as the Scripture ſpeaketh, ſaying; Thou art the <hi>Lambe of God that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world;</hi> which cannot admit any increaſe: becauſe, ſin being remitted, there remaineth nothing, and that which is nothing, cannot receiue any increaſe: neither can Gods act of remitting, receiue increaſe, himſelfe doth confeſſe it, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 195. where hee ſaith, <hi>Iuſtification as it is the worke of God, is without Magis or Minus.</hi> The remiſſion of new ſinnes, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe remiſſion of ſinnes, nor can poſſibly; becauſe, the ſinnes already remitted, are wholy taken away: the act of God remitting them, was extended vnto the totall aboliſhing of ſinne; ſo is it with the act of remitting new ſinnes, whereby there is no place for increaſe: for, that which is ſo done already, that no more can be done thereto, that cannot be increaſed. The antecedent is the Doctrine of our Church; in the firſt Sermon of ſaluation, a little after the beginning; where it ſaith, <hi>wee are waſhed from ſinne in ſuch ſort, that there remaineth not any ſpot of ſinne.</hi> The ſame
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21007:56"/> thing we finde, <hi>page</hi> 377. and 382. of that Booke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Neither can the declaring, that ſinne is remitted, increaſe the remiſſion of ſinne, which is no more, but as if you ſhould ſay, <hi>the tree is knowne by the fruit:</hi> as your ſelfe teach, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 197. but to <hi>increaſe, is as much as when warm water is made hotter, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the fire, with an augmentation and acceſſe of that heat;</hi> as your ſelfe ſay, <hi>Gagge, p.</hi> 142. which two things doe much differ. Would M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſay his riches were increaſed, if it were declared truely and fully what riches he hath? I hope he would not. In the like caſe he muſt ſay, the declaring, that ſinne is remitted, doth not increaſe remiſſion.

               <p>When I had come thus farre, I ſuppoſed here had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> beene an end of his pretended excuſes; but when I went on to peruſe the reſt, I found he had ſpent many pages to proue againſt, or for, iuſt no body, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 183. that</p>
               <p>Such is the changed eſtate of men iuſtified, that they are alſo regenerate, that are iuſtified.</p>
               <p>I ſay neither againſt, nor for: becauſe it was neuer a queſtion on foote by any parties in this world: for anſwer, I may returne him his owne words, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 196.</p>
               <p>In what place doe they ſpeake; God ſaue your honeſt credit, and name mee the place, quote the very words of the Authors, which are parties to that diſputation.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:21007:56"/>
               <p>But this is impoſſible for him euer to doe. If it bee anſwered, he would neuer haue put himſelfe thus far into the eye of the world, <hi>to barke at the moone-ſhine in the water:</hi> hee alleadgeth <hi>Becanus, Appeale, page</hi> 169. whoſe words ſeeme to incline ſomewhat that wayes. I anſwer, ſomething is the matter indeed, but he hath not expreſt it. The reaſon why I will not determine, nor inquire after. I will proceed to ſhew what it is, and by that it will appeare, it ſerueth not his turne any thing at all.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth thus touching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> ſinne.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>3 Originall ſinne (although there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them that beleeue, yet it) hath of it ſelfe the nature of ſinne,</hi> Artic. 9.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the firſt Homilie of Saluation, it ſaith thus:</p>
               <p>4 They which ſinne in act, are waſhed from their ſinnes in ſuch ſort, that there remaineth not any ſpot of ſinne that ſhall bee imputed to their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> decreeth, <hi>ſeſſ. 5. can.</hi> 5. in theſe words:</p>
               <p>The grace beſtowed in Baptiſme, doth take away whatſoeuer hath the true, and proper nature of ſin, and ſin is not onely raſed, and not imputed.</p>
               <p>Out of this Doctrine on both ſides, they inferre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, as if wee ſaid,</p>
               <p>After remiſsion of ſinnes and iuſtification, a man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21007:57"/> remaineth a ſinner truely, and that hee is alwaies foule and vncleane.</p>
               <p>As we may find in <hi>Bellarmine de Bap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. and <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 9. and <hi>cap. 7. Secundo, Tertio, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Vnto which, ſome of the learned in the Church of <hi>England</hi> do anſwer as he alledgeth, <hi>Appeal, p. 169. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are farre from that opinion; for wee teach toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with remiſsion of ſinnes wee doe receiue diuine grace, inabling man to forſake ſinne.</p>
               <p>What is to be ſaid to the point it ſelfe, will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the nature of remiſſion of ſins comes to be ſhewed; <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 31. §. But how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely thus much ſufficeth to ſet downe the true ſtate of the queſtion betweene the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point, which hee harpeth ſo much vpon; which doth alſo euidently ſhew, that this point hath nothing to doe with faith vnto Iuſtification, neither could it haue lengthened out his foggy and miſtie pretences brought to excuſe himſelfe from agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſagreeing from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point. Wherefore I leaue it, and proceed.</p>
               <p>So confident is he in this fancied victory, that from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> thence he inferreth in the ſame page 183. a diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe words;</p>
               <p>If they meant no otherwiſe then thus, as I conceiue they did not, I ſee no reaſon to diſſent from them.</p>
               <p>There can be no fitter anſwer to be giuen hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then to returne you your owne words, <hi>Appeale, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You cite no words, name no place, ſend me to no text,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21007:57"/> page, nor particulars, by any direction, that I may know where to finde, what you intend; a meere tricke of iugling companions. Marry I finde ſome things in the Councell of Trent, which I dare ſay will not downe, nor digeſt with you, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> oppoſing your conceit, or rather dreame, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peruerting the meaning of the Councell; the which, becauſe I haue a fit time. I will not let it alone till another.</p>
               <p>Where you ſay [<hi>If they meant</hi>] your meaning is, to refer vs to the decree of the councel of <hi>Trent:</hi> where</p>
               <p>It maketh <hi>Iuſtification to bee the pulling of vs out of the power of darkneſſe, and the tranſlation into the Kingdome of Chriſt.</hi> Seſſ. 6. cap. 3.</p>
               <p>And where it doth inſinuate the deſcription of the Iuſtification of a ſinner, that <hi>it is a tranſlation from that ſtate wherein man was borne, into the ſtate of grace,</hi> cap. 4.</p>
               <p>That you referre vs hither, or vnto no other place in the Councell, I take for granted.</p>
               <p>Where you ſay <hi>if they meant no more but thus,</hi> your purpoſe is to ſend vs to your owne words a few lines before: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is iuſtified is alſo regenerate.</p>
               <p>Now we haue the true ſenſe of the antecedent part; I let paſſe the conſequence of your propoſition, and come to your aſſumption, which muſt bee ſet downe in theſe words.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the Councell of Trent in theſe places,</hi> Seſſ. 6. c. 3. <hi>and 4., &amp;c.</hi> meaneth no more but that, <hi>a iuſtified man is alſo ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which aſſumption is wanting and in ſtead thereof
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21007:58"/> you bring vs the proofe of it in theſe words:</p>
               <p>As I conceiue they did not.</p>
               <p>Now all parts of the argument are ſet right, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it:</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is falſe, yea ſo odiouſly falſe, as that a man would not expect ſuch a falſhood to fall from the pen of a man that vnderſtands chalk from Cheeſe, or that had conſcience to declare the truth, when hee vnderſtood it. This might be made to appeare by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paſſages in the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> but I will content my ſelfe onely with theſe three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 Sanctification is by grace infuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtification it ſelfe is ſanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore Iuſtification it ſelfe is by grace infuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition and aſſumption are the words of the Councell of <hi>Trent, cap.</hi> 7. In which, 1. it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the ſame Iuſtification whereof it had ſpoken in the 3. and 4. Chapters. 2. By Iuſtification it ſelfe, it meaneth the quidditie, eſſence and being of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: both which are manifeſt of themſelues, they need no proofe. And that ſanctification is formally and intrinſically by grace infuſed, is likewiſe as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 The onely formall cauſe of Iuſtification, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace infuſed is the onely formall cauſe of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore grace infuſed is the very being of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition is a principle in nature, and agreed vpon for truth, therefore may not be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is the expreſſe words of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21007:58"/> Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the 7. Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3 If grace infuſed doth not concurre to the being of Iuſtification, then it is by remiſsion of ſins onely, excluding grace infuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the being of Iuſtification, is not by remiſsion of ſinnes onely, excluding grace infuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore the being of Iuſtification, is by grace infuſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence of the propoſition is ſo neceſſary, that it cannot be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is the words of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, <hi>c. 7. ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>What credit of truth is wanting in the aſſumption, he will ſupply by the proofe thereof; which forſooth is his owne conceit: he conceiued, they meant not otherwiſe than thus, therfore you muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue ſo to.</p>
               <p>Vnto which I might returne anſwer in his owne words, <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 178.</p>
               <p>Shall I bring proofes to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> for the ſnow is white? Who would not ſuffer himſelfe to bee perſwaded ſo: nay, becauſe he was otherwiſe by preconceit perſwaded, he ſaid, it did not ſo much as ſeeme white vnto him. Your opinions are your owne, you will opine what formerly you haue thought, ſo doe for me, and there an end.</p>
               <p>But I cannot ſo let it paſſe, becauſe you keepe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> theſe conceits at home; but ſo much are you filled with them, that you muſt needs vent them, or burſt. And you cannot bee contented with that: but you raile and reuile ſuch as diſſent from you; and (more then ſo) wee muſt now come to an agreement with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of Iuſtification, that haue diſſented for many ages, till M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his conceit ſprung vp in the world.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21007:59"/>
               <p>Therefore, vnto his conceit, I oppoſe the reſolued iudgements of all the Schoolemen, that haue liued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> all agreeing in this one ſentence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace infuſed, is eſſentiall vnto Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſhall we thinke, the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> would determine againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Surely no: Beſides, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath framed the decree out of <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was the firſt that brought the body of Diuinity into a compleat order: <hi>Peter Lombard, Richard, Altiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore, Albert,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> (the Predeceſſors of <hi>Thomas</hi>) not attaining thereunto, yet conſented with him, in this thing.</p>
               <p>Since the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> all on that ſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, doe vnderſtand the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> to place the primary and proper being of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in grace infuſed.</p>
               <p>I might amplify this bold and preſumptuous act of his (daring to oppoſe a multitude of learned men for ſome hundred yeares, deliuering their iudgments ſingly, and afterwards decreeing the ſame in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ioyntly; and laſt of all, the ſame decree ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and defended vniuerſally) but I leaue it, and conclude in his owne words, <hi>Appeale, p.</hi> 248.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You vnderſtand not the ſtate nor depth of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but ſcumme vpon the ſurface, and gibberiſh you cannot tell for what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much is enough (and too much) to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> ſaid touching his excuſe ſet down <hi>no</hi>. 4. Now I come to proue he did not meane as hee pretended there: but he meant to make <hi>grace enfuſed eſſentiall to Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> In which alſo I wil content my ſelfe with ſome

               <p>From which anſwer hee inferreth againſt him that

               <p>Vnto his foule, and vgly imputations, inferred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his anſwer; I ſay nothing: the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 52. <hi>Pſ. v.</hi> 2. 3. 4. 5. will giue him his leſſon for that.</p>
               <p>To the exception it ſelfe, I anſwer; It is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he did make this change <hi>from ſinne to grace, eſſentiall vnto the act of iuſtification.</hi> The phraſe and manner of his ſpeaking in this point; and the thing it ſelfe, doth euidently declare it.</p>
               <p>For 1. The like phraſe he vſeth when he ſaith, <hi>a ſinner is then iuſtified, when he is made iuſt:</hi> which can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood no otherwiſe then as if he had ſaid, he is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when he is made Iuſt, and by vertue of his being made Iuſt. 2. To iuſtifie (according to him) is to make Iuſt; and to make iuſt, is to be <hi>tranſlated;</hi> and the word <hi>tranſlated</hi> is the ſame w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the word <hi>changed;</hi> therfore (according to him) to be changed is to be iuſt, or iuſtified. 3. If to be <hi>changed</hi> doth ſet out a man alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy iuſt, and doth not ſignifie his being iuſt, then his purpoſe was to proue that ſome men are iuſt, and not to deſcribe Iuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fication. But he doth deſcribe it (as himſelfe profeſſeth) <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 173. and indeed ſo he muſt, or elſe he ſaith nothing to the purpoſe. 4. If the word <hi>changed</hi> do ſignifie ſanctifying grace, which alway goeth with Iuſtification; then hee muſt ſay a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21007:60"/> man is not iuſtified, till he be ſo changed. For hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth being iuſt, to the time when hee is changed: but hee will confeſſe that a man is iuſt, or iuſtified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſo changed, &amp; doth declare ſo much, <hi>Appeale page</hi> 172. where he maketh <hi>ſanctification a conſequent vpon iuſtification,</hi> and page 174. he ſaith, <hi>Iuſtification is not ſanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My laſt argument in this point I frame thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4 If God onely iuſtifieth, becauſe he onely createth a</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> 
                  <hi>new heart, then to create a new heart, is to iuſtifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But (according to</hi> M. <hi>Mountagu) God onely iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, becauſe he onely createth a new heart:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>Hee ſaith, <hi>God onely iuſtifieth, who alone createth a new heart within vs:</hi> In which ſentence hee bringeth the latter act of creating, to proue the former of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore (according to</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu,) to create a new heart, is to iuſtifie, and conſequently, grace infuſed, is eſſentiall to iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He bringeth the ſubſtance of this argument, in his <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 188. and 192. as an obiection made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but torne in pieces, that the ſtrength ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the weakeneſſe of his anſwer thereto, might be concealed.</p>
               <p>He anſwereth vnto it, three things.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Hee annexeth proofe for them all:</p>
               <p>And concludeth, <hi>if this bee Popery, I confeſſe I am a Papiſt,</hi> p. 191. <hi>And am content to paſſe for a Papiſt,</hi> p. 194. &amp; complaineth againſt the obiectors, with his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21007:61"/> wonted bitterneſſe, <hi>page</hi> 189. 190. and 191.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, this plea is idle: no liuing man did euer deny any of his three propoſitions; nor did charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Popery; (at leaſt,) The argument which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers vnto, hath no ſuch thing (as the Reader may ſee.) A worthy diſputer, that either knowes not, or cares not what he ſpeakes vnto. The fire cannot but burne, nor he forbeare his rayling, therefore he muſt not be blamed for it.</p>
               <p>I argue againſt both his Expoſitions, ſet downe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
                  <hi>no</hi>. 4, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he ſaid Iuſtification conſiſteth alſo in grace infuſed, hee meant to ſay, grace infuſed was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a iuſtified man,</hi> and by iuſtification, <hi>he vnderſtandeth the whole ſtate of a man reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, or neither of them:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>He pretendeth both, and both muſt be true, or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true. He that is found falſe in one thing, deſerues not to be truſted in any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he did not take that ſentence in both theſe ſenſes.</hi> I proue it: Firſt, for he ſaith, <hi>Appeale p. 169. I profeſſed at firſt to take Iuſtification onely in this acceptation,</hi> viz. <hi>For the declaration of the act of Iuſtification vpon man by the liuely fruits of a true faith, and for abſolution.</hi> Which is but one of the ſenſes, (at moſt) and ſeemes to be the firſt: now if he meant onely the firſt, or but one of them, his owne pen muſt giue the verdict, hee meant neither of them in deed and in truth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he make grace infuſed, <hi>accidentall to a iuſtified man, or in him that is iuſtified, declaring him that-hee is iuſt,</hi> then he did not deſcribe Iuſtification, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ending Sanctification; for vnto this Iuſtification,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21007:61"/> grace infuſed is eſſentiall and conſtitutiue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you meant the firſt, you meant not the ſecond. Thirdly, if in that ſentence hee intended to deſcribe Iuſtification, as comprehending Sanctification alſo; then he intended not to ſay, <hi>grace infuſed, is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to Iuſtification, or a iuſtified man:</hi> for vnto this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and man iuſtified, grace infuſed is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, making full and compleat the worke of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as if hee meant the ſecond, he did not meane the firſt.</p>
               <p>I proue againſt either of them ſingly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
               </p>
               <p>If when you ſaid, Iuſtification conſiſteth in grace infuſed; you meant to ſay a iuſtified man hath grace infuſed, then both thoſe ſentences doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But that they doe not. As the very ſight and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them will manifeſt.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſentence, iuſtification conſidered in it ſelfe, and without any perſon receiuing the ſame, is ſaid to conſiſt in grace. In the ſecond ſentence, not Iuſtification in it ſelfe, nor with the partie receiuing it; but the partie iuſtified, conceiued otherwiſe then as he is iuſtified, is ſaid to poſſeſſe or inioy grace infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, together with his iuſtification.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the firſt ſentence, you did not meane the ſecond.</p>
               <p>2 If by this ſentence, Iuſtification conſiſteth in grace infuſed, he meant to deſcribe Iuſtification, as it comprehendeth the whole ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man regenerate &amp; reconciled to God, then he agreeth fully with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which taketh it ſo. <hi>For,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:21007:62"/>
               <p>It deſcribeth Iuſtification to be <hi>A tranſlation from that ſtate, in which man was borne a Sonne of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, into the ſtate of grace, and adoption of the ſonnes of God,</hi> Councell of <hi>Trent, ſeſſ. 6. cap.</hi> 4. And more fully it ſaith, <hi>Iuſtification it ſelfe, is not onely remiſsion of ſinnes, but alſo ſanctification and renouation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, by a voluntary receit of grace, and gifts, from whence a man is iuſt of vniuſt, a friend of an enemie, and heire according to the hope of euerlaſting life,</hi> cap. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But by that ſentence, he meant ſo to deſcribe, &amp;c.</hi> (as is before ſet downe, <hi>no</hi>. 7, Wherein alſo he placeth his confidence, <hi>Appeale page</hi> 172. to giue ſatisfaction if any will be taken.</p>
               <p>Therefore when hee ſaith, Iuſtification conſiſteth in grace infuſed, he agreeth with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now at the laſt we are come to a finall concluſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> touching the conſiſting of Iuſtification in grace infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; wherein after many turnings, windings, and ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; now this waies, then that waies; ſome vnto the matter, ſome beſides the matter: we are come by his owne direction, and the euidence of the thing it ſelfe, vnto this concluſion, that hee agreeth with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we muſt inquire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p>Whether hee agreeth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſſenteth from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in aſſigning of the nature of remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>Touching which, thus he ſaith: Both forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and grace infuſed, are the act of Gods ſpirit in man.</p>
               <p>To the ſame effect the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> decreeth in theſe words.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:21007:62"/>
               <p>Grace beſtowed in Baptiſme, doth take away whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath the true and proper nature of ſin, ſeſſ. 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſentences of the Councell, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu,</hi> doe fully agree. He ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> It ſaith, <hi>grace;</hi> He ſaith, the <hi>ſpirit in man,</hi> It ſaith, <hi>grace receiued;</hi> Hee ſaith, <hi>remiſsion of ſinne, is the act of the ſpirit;</hi> It ſaith, <hi>grace taketh away the true and proper nature of ſinne:</hi> all which words are of the ſame value and ſignification.</p>
               <p>All the Interpreters of the Councell, doe extend this decree, vnto all ſinnes: (as well perſonall as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall) and that vpon good reaſon, as I ſuppoſe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what the Councell ſaith of grace beſtowed in Baptiſme, They apply alſo to the habit of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of Baptiſme: becauſe it is the ſame habit which is receiued by Baptiſme, &amp; without Baptiſme: which doth make their agreement cleare to the full.</p>
               <p>Moreouer; the moſt common opinion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> of the Councell, doe further ſay, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> doth, <hi>de Iuſtific. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 16:</p>
               <p>Habituall grace, hath foure formall effects, the firſt whereof is to purge ſinne.</p>
               <p>And thereby they make remiſſion of ſinne a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worke of grace: as when one pinne is driuen out by another, or one colour is blotted out by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some others, (but they are not many) are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that grace doth remit ſin by the way of merit: but the firſt opinion is moſt agreeable to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which in that decree cannot bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of taking away ſinne by the way of merit: becauſe habituall grace beſtowed vpon children, cannot bring forth workes; and no workes, no merits: beſides, if grace did merit remiſſion of ſinnes, then a man might haue grace for ſometime, and yet not haue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21007:63"/> his ſinnes remitted: For there may fall out ſometime after a man hath receiued grace wherein hee hath no opportunity vnto the doing of a meritorious worke.</p>
               <p>Vnto which opinion, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his words doe greatly incline: for he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtification by grace, and remiſsion of ſinnes, is the act of Gods ſpirit.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſayd, in what ſort grace doth make iuſt, in that ſort, grace doth remit ſinne; elſe he could not comprehend them both vnder one act: but muſt haue referred them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two acts. Now, it is agreed vpon by al, &amp; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath it, in the place laſt alleadged; That, to make iuſt, is a formall effect of habituall grace. And accordingly to remit ſinne, is a formall effect of habituall grace.</p>
               <p>Againe, he ſaith;</p>
               <p>The ſoule of man is the ſubiect of Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>In theſe words he ſpeaketh of the ſoule, not ſimply, as being the obiect of an outward worke: but as the ſubiect receiuing remiſſion of ſinnes into it; and how man ſhould receiue remiſſion of ſinne (by grace) into his ſoule, and that remiſſion not be a formall effect of grace, cannot poſſibly be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if in his opinion, ſinne doth expell grace formally, then he muſt be of opinion, that grace doth expell (which is to remit) ſinne formally.</p>
               <p>But he hath the firſt: <hi>Appeale, p.</hi> 173. where he ſaith,</p>
               <p>The propertie of thoſe ſinnes, that are more eminent, notorious, enormious, is to waſt the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Where, <hi>waſting the conſcience,</hi> muſt ſignifie the putting away of grace; for what is there in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that can be waſted by ſinne, but grace? and the act of <hi>waſting,</hi> muſt be a formall act; becauſe, ſinne is conceiued in ſuch a caſe to reſt and remaine in ſtead of grace.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:21007:63"/>
               <p>Therefore hee muſt be conceiued, to be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, remiſſion of ſinne, is a formall effect of grace.</p>
               <p>By this (I hope) it doth appeare, that hee agreeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> fully with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But to auoyd all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is requiſite that I remoue one obiection, which may be made after this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee placeth remiſsion of ſinnes in the pardon, and not-imputation of ſinnes,</hi> Gagge page 143. and in <hi>abſolution therefrom,</hi> Appeale pag 169.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore he maketh not remiſsion of ſinnes a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall effect of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; hee may ſay both, and yet agree with them: for, although the Councell of <hi>Trent, ſeſſ. 6. can. 11. and cap.</hi> 7. hath but implyed (not expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed) this manner of remitting ſinnes: yet all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters by one conſent doe teach both expreſly; except onely <hi>Gabriel Vaſquez, in 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">ae</hi>. diſp. 204. per tot:</hi> yea, he muſt hold the latter: though he doth hold the former; for pardon, &amp;c. is required alſo vnto the perfect doing away of ſinne, as <hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth, 3. <hi>part, q. 22. art. 3. C.</hi> And <hi>Suarez</hi> proueth at large, <hi>de grat. lib. 7. cap. 13. and</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And thus much (I hope) is ſufficient, to ſhew his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I come now in the next place, to ſhew his diſſent from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point of remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>What the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath decreed in the point, I will ſet downe, and then apply it. It ſaith,</p>
               <p>Good workes cannot put away our ſinnes, Artic. 12.</p>
               <p>In which ſentence, there is a direct contradiction put, vnto the Doctrine laſt recited out of Church of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21007:64"/> 
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and M. <hi>Mountagu.</hi> The terme <hi>put away</hi> muſt ſignifie that putting away which is called remiſſion, and not ſatisfaction; for this doth make recompence for ſinne, but doth not put away ſin; which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the deſtroying of the being, &amp; remaining of ſin it ſelfe. By denying the <hi>puting away of ſinne</hi> to good workes, the meriting of remiſſion of ſinne by grace, and the effects therof is denyed: for otherwiſe then ſo, good workes are not fit nor able to put away ſin: and himſelfe ſpeaks thus of it, <hi>Gagg. p.</hi> 156.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as good workes are the fruits of a liuely faith (as the Article ſpeaketh) that is of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace; the remiſſion of ſinnes that it denyeth to good workes, it denyeth to the habit of grace, and therein it denyeth that remiſſion of ſinne is a formall effect, or phyſicall worke of grace; foraſmuch as the remiſſion of ſin can be no other effect or operation of the habit of grace but formall, and Phyſicall. The Homilie of Almes, <hi>pag.</hi> 329. teaches the ſame thing expreſly, which is a proofe ſufficient: that M. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> doth diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and no diſſent in a matter of this kind, can be greater then a contradiction.</p>
               <p>Our Church doth teach poſitiuely, what remiſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> of ſinnes is; wherein it doth aſſigne a nature, contrary to that, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> doe giue vnto it. If I make that appeare. I doubt not then to ſay: M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> diſſenteth from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I doe it thus,</p>
               <p>The true knowledge of the remiſſion of ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the true vnderſtanding of theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. what is meant by ſinne, which is ſaid to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21007:64"/> Secondly, what act of God it is by which it is forgiuen.</p>
               <p>Sinne, of which a man may be denominated a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may be conceiued two waies: firſt, for the act of ſin paſt: ſecondly, for the will of ſinning: as <hi>Thomas</hi> hath truely obſerued, 3. <hi>part. q. 61. art. 4. C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The will of ſinning, is not the obiect of that act, which the Scripture calleth remitting: becauſe the will of ſinning, importeth an indiſpoſition vnto good, and an aptneſſe to ſinne, remaining in the will, from whence the Scripture doth not denominate a man a ſinner: but from the act of ſinne.</p>
               <p>The act of ſinne paſt, is the obiect of remiſſion, as is confeſſed on all ſides. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed it <hi>Seſſ. 6. cap.</hi> 5. where it maketh ſuch as are turned from God by ſinne, the men that are iuſtified. So doth all the expoſitors of the Councell, with one conſent, make the act of ſin the thing remitted; and from which a man is iuſtified. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath it, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 16. with whoſe teſtimony I will reſt contented, others may ſay the ſame thing; but not more, nor more cleerly then he hath done.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth it, in the firſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milie of ſaluation; where it nameth (a little after the beginning) <hi>ſinnes forgiuen, by the name of treſpaſses:</hi> and againe, <hi>ſins from which man is waſhed, and which are not imputed, it calleth ſinne in act or deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The act of God, whereby the ſinnes of man are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> remitted, is ſet out by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers titles, according to the courſe, and phraſe of Scripture: but of them all, one is the moſt fit, and of beſt ſignification for this preſent occaſion; <hi>viz.</hi> The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21007:65"/> 
                  <hi>not-imputing of ſinne:</hi> which it vſeth in the firſt Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of ſaluation, a little after the beginning, the words lie thus,</p>
               <p>Man is waſhed from his ſinnes, in ſuch ſort, that there remaineth not any ſpot of ſinne, that ſhall be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their damnation.</p>
               <p>In which ſentence, <hi>waſhing away the ſpots of ſinne,</hi> (which is the act remitting ſinnes) is reſolued into the act of <hi>not-imputing;</hi> where it ſaith, <hi>ſo waſhed as not imputed.</hi> Hee muſt not deny this Homilie to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for, hee doth auouch it to bee ſuch in his <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 190. and 194.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth aſſigne other acts of remitting ſinne, beſides this, in vſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The not-imputation of ſinne, is the ſole and onely act, whereby ſinnes are remitted.</p>

               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, 1. that ſinne is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> by a created being, (namely) the habit of grace. 2. That remiſſion of ſinne is wrought in the ſoule of man. 3. That the manner how ſinne is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by grace, is formall and phyſicall, as a painter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21007:65"/> that couereth a thing deformed with beauty and good ſhape.</p>
               <p>Our Church maketh, 1. the Creator directly and immediately the worker thereof. 2. It placeth the thing effected not in man; but in the outward eſtate and condition of man. 3. The manner of working to be meerly efficient, <hi>viz.</hi> God (out of his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Royall) diſcharging our account; Not putting our ſinnes to our reckoning.</p>
               <p>And thus much is ſufficient, to proue his totall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the nature of Iuſtification: and therewith I might put an end vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this whole point.</p>
               <p>But I will goe a little further to the ſatisfying of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the point propounded. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12. &amp;c. Wherein my labour will not be loſt, for that which I ſhall ſay, will ſerue aboundantly to ſhew, 1. how diuinely the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath determined in this point. 2. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon he had to depart from the doctrine of our Church in this point. 3. The great reaſon that euerie man hath to ſtriue for the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point, as for <hi>the faith once deliuered to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as may well be conceiued) doth thus diſpute,</p>
               <p>If no other act doth concurre vnto the remitting of ſinne, but the act of not-imputing of ſinne, <hi>then</hi> a man, after remiſsion of ſinne remaineth a ſinner; truely, and alwaies foule, and vncleane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But a man, after remiſsion of ſinne, remaineth not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21007:66"/> a ſinner; truely, foule, and vncleane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore beſides the act of not-imputing of ſinne, there is required ſome other act, vnto the remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne,</hi> viz. <hi>The infuſion of grace, whereby the true, and proper nature of ſinne, is taken away, rooted out, and aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument is framed out of the 4. and 9. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Bellar. de Bap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. and alſo taken out of thoſe places of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadged <hi>no</hi>. 13. the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent part of the propoſition is found <hi>de Bap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. where he alledgeth a paſſage out of <hi>Chemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> containing the ſame doctrine which I haue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the 9 Article, and the Homilie, at <hi>no</hi>. 13. out of which he inferreth, that we ſay, that <hi>ſinne is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe it is not imputed, and wee acknowledge not, that it is taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his diſputation <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. c. 9. Praeterea,</hi> and <hi>cap. 11. Illud autem &amp;c.</hi> the ſame thing is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The conſequent part of the propoſition, and the inference thereof from that antecedent, is in <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2 cap. 7. Secundo, &amp;c. Tertio, &amp;c.</hi> I haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med negatiuely the conſequent part of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe they deny the antecedent part of the propoſition: and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, in that place <hi>de Bap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. The <hi>Councell of Trent Seſſ. 5. can. 5 decreed againſt it.</hi> The aſſumption it ſelfe, is their own doctrine; as will be confeſſed on all ſides. The proofe of the conſequence ſeemeth to be theſe two things;</p>
               <p>1 <hi>The act of not-imputing, doth not take away ſinne.</hi> Confeſſed by our doctrine, <hi>no</hi>. 13. that ſaith, <hi>originall ſinne is in the iuſtified, and in it ſelfe is ſin properly, and the ſpots of actuall ſin doe likewiſe remaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:21007:66"/>
               <p>2 By the remaining of ſinne (that in it ſelfe is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable) a man is foule, vncleane, and a ſinner truly.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue ſet their diſputation in true form, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> and order: I might ſay, If M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> will maintain his doctrine of remiſſion of ſinnes <hi>no</hi> 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then he muſt diſpute thus too, &amp; be a worthy child to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a famous refuter of the Gagger: If he will not diſpute thus, he muſt reuoke that as falſe in it ſelfe, and a ſtranger to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto this argument many Diuines doe anſwer as he alleadgeth, <hi>Appeale p.</hi> 169. In theſe words,</p>
               <p>We are far from this abſurd opinion; for wee teach, with the action of God, remitting ſinne, concurreth another action of diuine grace, enabling man to forſake, and mortifie euery greater ſinne, which God hath pardoned.</p>
               <p>But, how fit this anſwer is, to giue ſatisfaction to any part of that argument; I leaue vnto others to iudge: becauſe, 1. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth confeſſe no leſſe then is in that anſwer, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 6. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. 2. It ſeemeth not fit to bee applyed to the conſequence of the propoſition; for that ſpeaketh of <hi>doing away of ſinne already committed:</hi> but this anſwer ſpeaketh of preuenting ſinne not yet committed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it appertain to the aſſumption, which doth not charge vs with the holding of any opinion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Other Diuines doe anſwer otherwiſe; I will name <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> one in ſtead of all: namely Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> in defence of M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> of inherent Iuſtice, 2. <hi>part. p.</hi> 421. his anſwer is long, but I will contract it into (ſo ſhort) a roome as I may, vſing his owne words.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:21007:67"/>

               </p>
               <p>In courſe of law and iudgement, the forme of iuſtice is, not to bee ſubiect to crime, or accuſation; and he is formally iuſt, againſt whom, no action, or accuſation is lyable by law, in this ſort a man becommeth iuſt, by pardon and forgiueneſſe; becauſe pardon being obtained, the law procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no further, and all imputation of the offence in law, is taken away, as if it had neuer beene committed: and this is the ſtate of our iuſtice in the ſight of God, our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, and thereby no accuſation is liable againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Before I apply this to the argument, It muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that, the word <hi>pardon</hi> in this teſtimony, is of the ſame value, and ſignification, with the word <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputing,</hi> vſed in the argument: for, by <hi>pardon,</hi> hee vnderſtandeth ſuch an act, as whereby the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the offence in law is taken away, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the imputation of the offence, is not to impute the offence. This anſwere lyeth againſt the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the proofe thereof: affirming, that the act of not-imputing ſinne, doth take away ſin, and proueth that affirmation, which proofe I may diſpoſe thus,</p>
               <p>Whereby we are made formally iuſt before God, that takes away all ſinne.</p>
               <p>This propoſition is a manifeſt truth, agreed vpon by all parties.</p>
               <p>But, not-imputation of ſinne is that, whereby wee are made formally iuſt, before God: <hi>For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By it, all crime, action, or accuſation and offence in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21007:67"/> law, is taken away, as if it had neuer beene committed, the law proceedeth no further; which is formall iuſtice in law, and our formall iuſtice before God.</p>
               <p>Therefore the not-imputation of ſinne doth take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinne.</p>
               <p>I might proceed further to ſhew the inſufficiency of the argument; but I forbeare ſo to doe, this that I haue ſaid is ſufficient to iuſtifie, and explicate the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of remiſſion of ſinnes, and iuſtification, which is as much as I intended, and this place requires.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> (notwithſtanding all this) will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſay, his words alleadged, <hi>no</hi> 23. &amp;c. are forced beyond his intent, and that (in his iudgement) there is no other act in remiſſion of ſinne, but pardon, or not-imputation, he muſt looke vnto it; for as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> affirmeth, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. cap. 1. &amp; 6, That opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is proper to Caluine.</hi> If that bee true, (as it is moſt true,) how can hee thinke it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 72.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of the Church of England, is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vpon the party of a faction, that hath ſo long had a ſchiſme on foote againſt it, to bring in Geneuaniſme into Church and State, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If it bee not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> what doth it in Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his Booke, that voweth to thruſt out all priuate opinions, as <hi>Irchins to their holes, where they were bred, and Baſtards to the Pariſh where they were borne, and to the whipping poſt according to law?</hi> and like a valiant and true Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to <hi>defend the Doctrine of his Mother, the Church
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21007:68"/> of England.</hi> Therefore I may conclude, let him turne himſelfe which wayes he will, he ſhall finde himſelfe to agree, either with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or with <hi>Caluine;</hi> if with them, then is hee a Papiſt; if with him, then doth hee take the courſe <hi>to bring in Popes into euery Pariſh,</hi> as himſelfe inferreth, and which thing himſelfe <hi>curſeth with a heauy and bitter curſe, Appeale, page</hi> 44. I hope hee will be rather a Papiſt, then a Caluiniſt, curſed to hell with his owne mouth,</p>
               <p>I ſhould now ſhew that this faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is erroneous, but hee hath brought nothing to proue it true, therefore I haue nothing to anſwer. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in the decree already repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>no</hi> 23. ſaith, three things, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, doth not take away ſinne;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>ſinne is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and taken away;</hi> thirdly, <hi>the habit of grace doth take away ſinne. Bellarmine</hi> beſtoweth great paines to proue the ſecond, which was neuer denyed, <hi>de Bap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. for the firſt he doth onely ſay it; for the third he hath not ſo much as one place of Scripture to pretend for it: onely <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 16. he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a proofe from the nature of ſinne that is remitted, which can proue nothing; becauſe it is as doubtfull as the thing in queſtion; by which it is manifeſt, the Scripture knoweth it not: and conſequently it is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. If Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> thinketh not thus, let him produce the word of God for the proofe of it, and he ſhall haue anſwer, till then it muſt goe for ſuch.</p>

               <p>THat wee may proceed in this queſtion, in the ſame order that wee haue done in the former, three things muſt be propounded.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Whether this propoſition: <hi>A man may fall from grace:</hi> be true or not.</item>
                  <item>2 Whether that propoſition conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or not.</item>
                  <item>3 Whether that propoſition diſſenteth from the Church of <hi>England</hi> or not.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I haue propounded the firſt of his propoſitions to be diſcuſſed, and not any of the reſt: becauſe they doe but explicate, and ſet out the meaning of this. The ſecond, and third, ſheweth who they be that doe loſe grace, and how farre they doe loſe grace. The fourth ſets out the next cauſe that procureth the loſſe of grace. The handling of theſe three will come in (each one) in his ſeuerall place.</p>
               <p>By the terme <hi>fall away,</hi> is ſignified the loſſe of grace, and is as much as if it were ſaid, hee that hath receiued grace, may loſe that grace, and be deſtitute thereof. By <hi>grace</hi> is meant the habit of holineſſe, or that inward forme, diſpoſition, or qualitie, out of which the workes of piety, in the outward actions of mans life, doe flow, and whereby hee is ordered and ſet into the way of eternall happineſſe. The word <hi>may,</hi> ſignifieth the poſſibility in the euent of the ſeparation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21007:69"/> of man and grace, as we vſe to ſay, a man may loſe his life.</p>
               <p>That he doth conſent with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> farre as the Councell hath decreed) it is plaine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident: now the Councell muſt bee conceiued to ſpeake of euery man that is iuſtified, whether prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, or not predeſtinate: for it ſpeaketh of man iuſtified without limitation. Secondly, it muſt bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the loſſe of all grace receiued. For it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the loſſe of the habit. If a man loſeth the habit, he loſeth all. Thirdly, it muſt bee conceiued that the Councell ſpeakes of a loſſe finall in ſome: becauſe it ſpeaketh not of the recouery againe of any, and that is as much as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſaith: but becauſe wee haue not theſe things expreſly in the Councell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt haue recourſe vnto the Interpreters, for the vndoubted minde of the Councell: <hi>Bellarmine de Iuſti. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 14. ſaith:</p>
               <p>We haue example in three which loſt their Iuſtice, and did recouer it againe: and of fiue that did ſo loſe their Iuſtice, as that they became reprobates.</p>
               <p>Where we haue M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his ſentence fully and plainely.

               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſuppoſeth that the reprobate alſo doe ſometimes receiue the habit of holineſſe, and ſo ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi> too, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 14 where hee hath the ſame thing for his title, and concludeth it in the Chapter,</p>

               <p>I haue beene aſsured, that, <hi>Arminius</hi> did hold, not onely Interciſion for a time; but alſo abſciſion, and abiection too for euer. That a man called, and iuſtified through the grace of God, might fal away againe from grace totally, and finally, and become a caſt away, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, for euer.</p>
               <p>He muſt bee vnderſtood to ſpeake this of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate,</hi> otherwiſe he putteth no diffence betweene <hi>Arminius</hi> and his owne profeſſed opinion; whether he conſenteth therewith, or diſſenteth therefrom, he ſaith nothing expreſly. That he doth diſſent from <hi>Arminius</hi> it is not probable; for hee had ſufficient reaſon to haue proteſted his diſſent, if hee could haue
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21007:70"/> done it with truth. It is very probable hee doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: becauſe being charged with it hee holds his peace. The old prouerbe is, the <hi>ſilence of the accuſed is a confeſsion of guiltineſſe.</hi> Which ſeldome times proues vntrue, what hee is of certainty is knowne to God, and himſelfe; hee <hi>ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maſter:</hi> it is meet I meddle no further but with his poſitions and proofes: wherefore I leaue this and proceed.</p>
               <p>We haue no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that, the Church of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>England</hi> was euer of opinion, that the habit of grace can be loſt: for if it were, then muſt it alſo beleeue, that, 1 Some reprobate is alſo ſanctified. 2 Some ſins are mortall, other ſome veniall. 3. The habit of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the works thereof be perfect Iuſtice, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate vnto the diuine Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. Purgatory, Pardons, Maſſes, Trentals, Dirges, &amp;c. be profitable vnto ſome that be dead; but we know by perpetuall experience, that our Church abhorreth, and the profeſſors of her faith publikely, and priuately, proteſt their deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all theſe Articles of the popiſh faith, therefore we haue a cloud of witneſſes, that, do all teſtifie, that, the Church of <hi>England</hi> maketh the loſing of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace no part of her faith. Moreouer, in the 22. Article it doth expreſly diſclaime the Romiſh doctrine concerning <hi>Purgatory and pardons.</hi> Laſtly, This point of <hi>falling from grace</hi> hath beene common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vniuerſally reiected: as well by Miniſters, as priuate men, and no man queſtioned (in the leaſt ſort) for doing wrong thereby to the faith of our Church: which is a moſt evident proofe, that they taught and beleeued as our Church euer beleeued.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21007:71"/> If it be anſwered, ſome in our Church haue taught falling from grace; I reply, It is true, ſome haue ſo done, but they haue beene but a few, and cryed down too, by the moſt, and thruſt off with no ſmall ſigne of diſlike from authoritie.

               <p>In the 16. Article we read: After wee haue receiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the holy Ghoſt, wee may depart away from grace, and fall into ſinne.</p>
               <p>That the full force of this argument may appeare, and my anſwer may bee directly, and fitly, applyed thereunto, it is needfull that I put it into due forme, and thus it will ſtand.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer is comprehended in the 16 Article is the publike doctrine of our Church.</p>
               <p>But that a man may depart from grace is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 16. Article.</p>
               <p>Therefore that a man may depart from grace is the publike doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:21007:71"/>
               <p>I anſwer; if he will ſtand to his propoſition hee may well be inrolled for a child obedient, and a Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt valiant, vnto his mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Bellarmine</hi> and all the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are but faint-hearted cowards in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the acts in Councels doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto faith: The diſputations that goe before, the reaſons that be added, nor the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that are brought, doe not appertaine to faith, but, onely the naked decrees, and of them, not all, but onely ſuch as are propounded as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith.</p>
               <p>So ſaith <hi>Bellarmine de Concil. auct. lib. 2. cap. 12. Quartum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> and no Papiſt euer durſt giue more then thus; yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> dares giue to the Church of <hi>England</hi> more then this. Euery ſentence in the Articles (with him) is matter of faith: and ſo he doth equall them vnto the ſcriptures, to whom it belongeth that euery ſentence be a matter of faith, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> truely auerreth in the place laſt alleadged.</p>
               <p>If he will diſclaime that propoſition, his argument falleth of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>To anſwer more ſpecially, that Article compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth two concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Euery one of the concluſions in that Article is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo vnderſtood is true; but your aſſumption is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21007:72"/> falſe. Departing from grace is not any concluſion in the Article.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that euery ſentence in the Article is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> yet this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle will not profit you: for,</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe (I grant) the Article doth teach departing from grace, but in this ſenſe the Article hath nothing in fauour of you, much leſſe hath it your falling from grace, in expreſſe words: for yours is of <hi>loſing the habit of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be replyed the word <hi>depart</hi> may not be taken in that ſenſe. I reioyne, it may bee ſo taken in this place: becauſe he that hath the habit of grace doth alwaies firſt <hi>neglect</hi> the motion and calling of actuall grace, before hee commits ſinne, and this I take as granted; Therefore you muſt proue that the Article doth vnderſtand it otherwiſe then ſo, elſe it can haue no ſtroke in your buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Let it be admitted (in courteſie) that, the Article ſpeaketh of the <hi>loſse of grace:</hi> yet it will come farre ſhort of your purpoſe: for it cannot ſpeake of the loſſe of the habit of grace. I proue it, from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle it ſelfe, and your owne doctrine, thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The habit of grace is loſt by ſin.</hi> So ſay you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace in the Article is not loſt by ſinne.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace is loſt, therefore ſinne committed.</hi> So ſaith the Article.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore grace in the Article is not the habit of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:21007:72"/>
               <p>By this it is moſt euident, and paſt doubt, that, there is nothing in the Article that auoucheth the loſſe of the habit of grace. But pardon him this miſtake, I will giue my word for him, hee neuer ſtudied the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to find the true ſenſe of it. Doe you thinke his ſtudie ſo meane, as that he would condiſcend ſo low, as to Engliſh Articles? I aſſure you no. I tell you, and he tells it me, <hi>Appeale, pag. 11. Hee neuer ſtudied Baſtingius Chatichiſme, Fenners diuinitie, Bucanus, Trelcatius, Polanus, and ſuch like. His learning is all old: The Apoſtles Canons, Polycarpus, Denis, Linus, Cletus, Clemens, Annacletus, Amphilochius, and others of their time, are his puefellowes, and hourly companions.</hi> And he hath good reaſon for it too; <hi>The neerer the fountaine the clearer the ſtreame; the further off the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, pag.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>His ſecond argument beginneth, <hi>Appeale, p.</hi> 32. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and is thus to be framed,</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer is taught in the Homilies, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, and ſubſcribed doctrine of the Church of <hi>England, For</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Booke of Homilies was firſt compoſed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in King</hi> Edwards <hi>time, approued, and iuſtified, in Parliament in Queene</hi> Elizabeths <hi>daies, and authoriſed againe of late to be read in Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that a man may fall away from grace, is taught in the Homilies.</p>
               <p>Therefore falling from grace is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; a man would verily thinke hee would haue vs beleeue his propoſition to be a certaine, and vndeniable, truth: he beſtows ſo much ſweat in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21007:73"/> proofe of it: but (good man) hee meant nothing leſſe; or elſe at the turning ouer of a new leafe, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new man; for he profeſſeth himſelfe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind in the 260 <hi>pag.</hi> following, in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I willingly admit the Homilies, as containing certain godly and wholſome exhortations: but not as the publike dogmaticall reſolutions, confirmed of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>They haue not dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall poſitions, or doctrine to bee propugned, and ſubſcribed in all and euery point. They may ſeeme to ſpeake ſomewhat too hardly, and ſtretch ſome ſaying beyond the vſe, and practice of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>The ancienteſt Fathers ſometimes doe hyperbolize in their popular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which in dogmaticall deciſions they would not doe, nor auow the doctrine by them ſo deliuered. Now after this inforcing ſort may our Homilie ſpeake, and be ſo interpreted, which are all popular Sermons, fitted vnto the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of common people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, there is good reaſon why we ſhould take his ſecond thoughts, for the better, and ſo leaue him tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pling his own propoſition into the dirt, by which meanes, his aſſumption doth not deſerue anſwer.</p>
               <p>But it may be, he will put new life into his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by a ſpeciall priuiledge that this homilily hath aboue the reſt, namely that it is for explication of the doctrine contained in the Article.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; he ſeemeth ſo to pretend, <hi>Appeale, pa.</hi> 32. but it is falſe, we find not any direction from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to the Homilie, nor any reflection in the homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon the Article: neither can the one explicate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21007:73"/> the other: but are really diſtinct concluſions, and proofes.</p>
               <p>The Article ſaith,</p>
               <p>He departeth from grace, therefore he ſinneth.</p>
               <p>The Homilie ſaith,</p>
               <p>He falleth from God by a wicked life, therefore is depriued of grace.</p>
               <p>Hee that can make new Articles, can create new expoſitors.</p>
               <p>Although this bee ſufficient to ſatisfie the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> yet I will goe on to examine that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. In proofe of his aſſumption, he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>The title of the Homilie is of falling away from God, which very title is ſufficient warrant for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this point.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this title hath nothing to doe with the loſſe of grace: <hi>falling from God</hi> ſignifies turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Gods law, and ſo the Homilie it ſelfe (a little after the beginning) doth expound the title, and ſaith,</p>
               <p>They that may not abide the Word of God, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſtubbornneſſe of his owne heart, they goe, and turne away from God.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>falling from God,</hi> ſhould bee meant <hi>loſing of grace,</hi> then the Homilie muſt bee conceiued thus to reaſon;</p>
               <p>If you loſe your grace, then God will take his grace from you.</p>
               <p>For in that ſort the Homilie doth reaſon from <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from God,</hi> as the reading thereof will ſhew: but it were moſt abſurd to thinke that the Homilie would ſo reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:21007:74"/>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon for the ſame purpoſe, is taken out of the Homilie it ſelfe, and ſtandeth in this forme;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that are depriued of grace and heauenly life, which they had in Chriſt, and become as without God in the world, giuen into the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as was</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Iudas, <hi>they loſe grace totally, and finally. But according to the Homilie, the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtified are thus depriued.</hi> For:</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>they were in Chriſt, they continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>according to the Homilie, the truely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified may loſe their grace totally and finally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this argument, hee thinkes the cauſe is his at common law: yee muſt now yeeld, or turne heretike againſt the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but he is much miſtaken. The homilie doth affirme thus much by the way of rhetoricall enforcement, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to take heed they turne not away from Gods Law. It being ſo vnderſtood, I grant the whole reaſon, but it profits him not. He promiſed, <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 5. the poſitiue, and declaratory Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but rhetoricall enforcements are not ſuch.</p>
               <p>It may be, ſome will ſay, there is a truth in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement. I anſwer; what truth ſoeuer there is in it, this is certaine, the faith of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not contained in it. No man (well aduiſed) will ſend vs to ſeeke for the faith of our Church vnto an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vrging the practice of a duty, in a popular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But what that truth is, we may beſt learne from the Author of this Homilie himſelfe, whoſe meaning we finde to be comprehended in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>By ſuch threatnings of Gods <hi>taking away of grace.</hi>

               <p>By which it is euident, the opinion of the Author of the Homily was not, that, man <hi>that had grace, ſhould by ſinning be brought to that condition</hi> indeed and in the thing, that, his habit of grace ſhould be taken from him, but, that the vrging of ſuch ſeuerity did fitly ſerue to reſtraine man from ſinning: &amp; to reduce him vnto repentance. Which being ſo, all the confidence which he put in this argument, doth vaniſh, and come to nothing; and himſelfe may bee aſhamed, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſo great confidence therein, <hi>p.</hi> 32. 33. and 34. I might alſo returne him the like amplifications vnto the ſeuerall parts of my anſwer, as might fit to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall amplifications of his argument, but I let ſuch things paſſe.</p>
               <p>His third argument, I finde, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 33. &amp;c. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in theſe words,</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; this argument requires little to bee ſaid to it: becauſe it preſumeth, that, the Article ſpeaketh of loſing the habit of grace; which hee hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor can; yea, I haue ſhewed the Article may bee vnderſtood otherwiſe, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vnderſtood ſo, <hi>no</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the aſſumption is falſe; that 16. Article doth not ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man may recouer the grace he hath loſt.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>The expreſſe words of the Article are,</p>

               <p>Which two ſentences doe (moſt really) differ. This man is very willing to abuſe the vnderſtanding, that dareth thus boldly falſify words vpon record, againſt the ſight of the eye.</p>
               <p>His fourth argument is ſet downe, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 36. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and thus he beginneth;</p>
               <p>4 In the publike ſeruice of our Church, you ſhall finde alſo as much as falling from grace commeth too.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; he promiſed <hi>poſitiue, and declaratory Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and expreſſe words,</hi> affirming his falling from grace, and now he paies vs with conſequences; a fault you reproued very often, and many a faire title you gaue your aduerſary the Gagger for it.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21007:75"/> Or does hee thinke to finde any ſo voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to beleeue him? Surely no, for that were a worke endleſſe. If the faith of our Church be in this conſequence, why not in ſecond vpon the firſt, and a third vpon the ſecond, &amp;c? And this is enough to ſatisfie the whole: but leſt he ſhould haue an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of himſelfe, if I ſhould cut him off thus ſhortly: therefore I will ſet downe what that is, which he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>is as much as falling from grace commeth too,</hi> and this it is;</p>

               <p>I anſwer; firſt, this is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſecond reaſon for this point, <hi>de Iuſti. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 14. ſecondly, theſe are not records of the faith of our Church: no publike act of our Church hath made them ſuch. Beſides, the Bookes themſelues be incompetent for that vſe; the one being a forme of adminiſtration of Prayers, and Sacraments: the other, ſhort precepts for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Infants.

               </p>
               <p>I meane Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> whoſe words are theſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Sacrament of Baptiſme (by the ſenſible ſigne of water) the inuiſible grace of God is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs,</hi> Artic. 5. diuiſ. 8. folio 250.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little ones being Baptiſed, and ſo the members of Chriſt,</hi> Artic. 8. diuiſ. 16. folio 291.</p>
               <p>Thus farre Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> is for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> but let him interpret himſelfe, and make vp his iudgement full, touching the vſe of the Sacrament, and then wee ſhall finde him directly againſt him, and for that end he ſaith thus;</p>
               <p>We confeſſe, that Chriſt by the Sacrament of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, hath made vs fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, that we are the members, and hee is the head. This merueilous coniunction and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, is firſt begun and wrought by faith, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the ſame incorporation is aſſured vnto vs, and increaſed in our Baptiſme: wherein muſt be conſidered, that the holy myſteries doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but rather continue, and confirme this incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, <hi>Artic. 1. diuiſ. 13. folio 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be here demanded; how this iudgement of Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> doth proue againſt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mountagu.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, thus, If in his iudgement, the Doctrine of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21007:76"/> Church of <hi>England</hi> doth diue to the Sacrament of Baptiſme no more but the renewing, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our incorporation into Chriſt, and grace by Chriſt; then in his iudgement the places alleadged out of the forme of priuate baptiſme, and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, doe not meane to ſay</p>
               <p>Euery Child baptiſed is (thereby) put into the ſtate of grace and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>For he was not ignorant of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſet downe in thoſe places, or in any other, neither would hee deliuer the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> otherwiſe then hee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be.</p>
               <p>But that hee did ſo conceiue of it, his words doe ſhew, and he addeth, that, our <hi>incorporation is begun firſt, and afterwards aſſured, and increaſed in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> which doth not begin it: which is ſo plaine, full, and direct a contradiction vnto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu;</hi> as the mind can deuiſe, or words expreſſe.</p>
               <p>If (yet) this teſtimony will not ſerue, let the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in the 25. and 27. Articles) tell vs, what effects it doth giue vnto the Sacraments: where it aſſigneth</p>
               <p>To the Sacraments in generall, that they are:</p>
               <p>1 Tokens of Chriſtian profeſsion. 2. Signes of Gods good will. 3. He doth by them quicken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith.</p>
               <p>Of Baptiſme in ſpeciall our Church ſaith,</p>
               <p>1 It is a ſigne of regeneration. 2 An inſtrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are grafted into the Church. 3 By it, the promiſes of forgiueneſſe of ſinne, and adoption are ſealed. 4. Faith is confirmed, and grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21007:77"/>
               <p>Theſe, &amp; no more but theſe, are the effects of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme aſſigned by our Church, it hath not a word of <hi>putting the baptiſed into the ſtate of grace and ſalvation by Baptiſme.</hi> If it be anſwered: the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, and Catechiſme is a ſupply to make full the doctrine of the Articles. I reply; ſo to ſay, is wholly without authority, &amp; fondly without ſhew of reaſon. The Articles were made vpon great deliberation, and of purpoſe to ſettle an vnitie in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore it would not omit principall points, and ſet downe others, that are ſubordinate, and not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion.</p>
               <p>If the profeſſors of the faith of our Church (pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and priuately, in writing, and by word of mouth) haue taught and beleeued of the Sacraments, no otherwiſe then is laid downe in the Articles: and is maintained by Biſhop <hi>Iewell;</hi> and all of them doe deny that the habit of grace is beſtowed in baptiſme, and doe deny it as the erroneous faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> then may we well ſay that the Church neuer meant to ſet downe any other faith but that: for all the children were not ignorant in their mothers faith, nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo careleſſe of her faith, as to ſuffer it to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and her intent to be changed.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as, ſhe could not be ignorant, what was done, nor wanted power to redreſſe things done amiſſe.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid ſome haue taught as M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> doth: I anſwer; it hath beene in a corner then; He that did ſo <hi>Crept in at the window:</hi> neither ſhepheard, nor ſheepe knew it. If Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> will be one of them he may be for me. I enuy not his happineſſe, nor will follow his courſe.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:21007:77"/>
               <p>To conclude this argument; M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> in this point agreeth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in another point of their erronious faith.</p>
               <p>The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The grace of Iuſtification is beſtowed by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that vnto all, &amp;c. ſeſſ. 7. can.</hi> 4. 7. &amp; 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Sacrament of baptiſme is the inſtrument all cauſe of Iuſtification, without which no man is iuſtified, ſeſſ. 6. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>And this faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is explicated and defended by <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> as in other places, ſo in theſe. 1 <hi>Of the Sacraments in generall, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Of Baptiſme in ſpeciall. lib. 1. cap. 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Euery child baptiſed is put thereby into the ſtate of grace and ſaluation.</hi> Iuſt as they doe.</p>
               <p>And thus much for this argument, and all the reſt which hee pretendeth to take from the authenticall records of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He bringeth others from the teſtimonies of ſingular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> men, liuing in our Church, which indeed doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue anſwer: but becauſe hee hopeth by them to helpe <hi>a lame dog ouer the ſtile,</hi> and to vphold a cauſe ready to fall: I will propound and examine them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; this Sylogiſme is falſe, the middle terme is predicated in the propoſition, and ſubiected in the aſſumption: it ought to be thus framed:</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ſome that were the learnedſt &amp;c. Did aſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; the aſſumption is a vaunt of his bragging veine, and more then the parties themſelues would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, or he can proue: he knoweth not who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, &amp;c. they were dead long before he was borne, and there is no record of their names.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The called, and iuſtified according to the purpoſe of Gods election, might, and did ſometime fall into grieuous ſinnes, and thereby into the preſent ſtate of wrath:</hi> yet</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did neuer fall either totally,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You report him to ſay, they fell into the ſtate of damnation, which importeth a falling totally.</p>
               <p>The booke reporteth him, denying falling totally, or finally:</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch is alſo falſe: the book hath not a word that reporteth any confirmation of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Doctor <hi>Ouerall.</hi> His happe was hard, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many words, he could not light vpon one true one, and his face very audatious that durſt affirme a falſhood for truth, againſt the light of the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. He talketh of <hi>conſcience, and honeſty, and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerell,</hi> and I know not what: Hee muſt tell vs vnder which of thoſe heads this allegation ſhall be ranged: for he hath beſt skill in ſuch language; the allegation it ſelfe ſtandeth vnder the cenſure of the reader, and the allegator at the barre of the Almighty; therefore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21007:79"/> I leaue this and paſſe to the next.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue ſpoken to the matter vrged in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> two arguments, now muſt I ſay a word, or two, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the concluſion of them both, which ſaith,</p>
               <p>Some of the learnedſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Vnto which I haue theſe two things to ſay, firſt, he getteth nothing though it were granted him. He ought to proue</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>teacheth his falling from grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which will not follow vpon his concluſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe <hi>learnedſt</hi> he ſpeaketh of, <hi>may be a faction prevailing in the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his intent is to ſay, <hi>all the learned</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> doe maintain falling from grace: for he ſaith, <hi>Ap. p. 28.

                  <hi>Your prime leaders haue vnderſtood the Tenet of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to be as I haue reported it, and accordingly they haue complained againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; it is very likely hee would conclude from hence,</p>
               <p>Therefore you muſt ſo vnderſtand it alſo.</p>
               <p>I let paſſe his bitterneſſe, for that hurteth none that thinke not of it. The Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is vnderſtood according to the primary ſenſe and meaning thereof, and ſometimes alſo in a forced interpretation: ſome haue complained of, and obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt this latter: and ſo farre I grant this whole reaſon: and good reaſon they had too for ſo doing. It becommeth the Paſtors &amp; people of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to diſcouer, &amp; detect the corruptors of their faith. But againſt the firſt, neuer any excepted, neither is there any reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why: Take the words of our Church as they lie, force them not to ſerue a turne, and they are familiar to vnderſtanding, and of a manifeſt truth.

               </p>
               <p>The teſtimonies of Scripture are ſo many, and ſo cleere, that, it is to be admired how it could come into the minde of a man to ſay, Grace could not be loſt.</p>

                  <hi>Falling from grace is fully cleared, and reſolued in Scripture,</hi> Gagge, page 165.</p>

                  <hi>The Scripture is expreſſe for falling from grace,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, page 36.</p>
               <p>I will giue anſwer to all the allegations produced: let them be <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mountagues,</hi> or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer elſe: Truth may be defended againſt any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer.</p>
               <p>The whole multitude of their allegations, may be reduced vnto two Sylogiſmes: the former (whereof) ſtandeth thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If euery righteous man may, and ſome doe, leaue his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity, then he that hath grace, may loſe that grace.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The moſt righteous man liuing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually doth, or may, mortally tranſgreſſe. Where mortall ſin is committed, God is diſobeyed. Where God is diſobeyed, he will not abide.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21007:81"/> Where he wil not abide, grace cannot conſiſt. Where grace cannot conſiſt, it muſt needs be loſt.</hi> Gagge, page 161.</p>
               <p>But euery righteous man may, and ſome doe, leaue his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that hath grace, may loſe that grace.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; the words <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> in this argument, muſt be taken for the act, not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: and he doth ſo vnderſtand it, I take as granted.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, the aſſumption is true, and needs no proofe: yet notwithſtanding, hee alleadgeth many places of Scripture, as <hi>Ezech. cap. 18. 24. 26. cap. 33. 12. 13. 18. Matth. cap. 12. 24. Luke cap. 8. 13. Iohn cap. 15. 2. Matth. cap. 24. 12. Rom. cap. 11. 20. 21. 1 Tim. cap. 6. 20. cap. 1. 18. 19. cap. 4. Gal. cap. 5. 4. 2 Pet. 2. 20. 21. 22. Heb. cap.</hi> 6. 4. and he concludeth, that <hi>infinite are the teſtimonies of Scripture to the purpoſe that theſe ſpeake vnto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which may be applyed vnto the aſſumption of this reaſon, and cannot bee applyed to any other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: neither doe they affirm any more but this: <hi>viz. euery righteous man may, and ſome doe, omit holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and commit ſinne in the actuall diſobedience to Gods law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, hee addeth diuers examples of righteous men, that <hi>neglected their obedience to Gods law, and committed actuall ſinne.</hi> Which muſt be referred vnto the proofe of the latter part of the aſſumption, and can belong to no other: by which it is manifeſt, that all this goodly ſhew, and bumbaſted brag, of infinite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, <hi>all teaching falling from grace:</hi> at the laſt, commeth to no more but what euery man will grant, and being granted, will profit him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21007:81"/> hee is not thereby one hayre the neerer to this concluſion;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man may loſe the habit of grace.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the propoſition is naught, and the proofe thereof falſe, in many branches thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed onely vpon his owne word, without the leaſt ſhew or pretence of proofe. Surely this man meant not ſincerely, when hee vndertooke to proue, that, which no man did euer deny, but takes as granted, and leaues vnproued that which all men doe deny, that ioyne not in faith with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That it may appeare I ſay true: I will giue you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome faults in the conſequence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and proofe thereof.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the propoſition dependeth vpon this ſentence;</p>
               <p>The habit of grace departeth from him that actually diſobeyeth Gods law.</p>
               <p>If this ſentence be true, his conſequence is good: if it be falſe, the conſequence is naught: the latter part doth not follow vpon the former; but this ſentence, <hi>the habit of grace, &amp;c.</hi> is moſt falſe, as will appeare.</p>
               <p>To make it ſeeme true, in the proofe of his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> he doth firſt diſtinguiſh of ſinne, and then tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs what kinde of ſinne it is that maketh grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Laſtly, hee giueth a reaſon why that departeth through this: but how truely this is affirmed, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proued, we ſhall ſee in the next paſſage.</p>
               <p>The firſt branch of his proofe ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euery righteous man may, or doth ſinne mortally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which ſentence he taketh two things as granted.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1 Some ſinnes are mortall; ſome veniall, and not mortall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:21007:82"/>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2 A man habituated by ſanctitie, may commit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I anſwer, if by <hi>mortall,</hi> hee meant no more, but ſinne tending, and conducing vnto damnation, it would not be denyed him, that ſinne is mortall: but thus he vnderſtands it not: for then he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh ſinne into <hi>mortall</hi> and <hi>veniall:</hi> for all ſinne in this ſenſe is mortall. If by <hi>veniall,</hi> he vnderſtood no more, but ſin not deſeruing damnation by Gods not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputing it, I will grant, that ſinne is veniall: but hee muſt not vnderſtand it thus: for ſo, all the ſinnes of the iuſtified are veniall or (to ſpeake in the words of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> firſt Homilie of ſaluation, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the beginning:)</p>
               <p>Their ſinnes are waſhed in ſuch ſort, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not any ſpot of ſinne that ſhall bee impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their damnation.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore, that hee taketh <hi>mortall</hi> and <hi>veniall</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. Which being true, that diſtinction is denyed: and ſo he begs the queſtion, and proues it not. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo denyed, that, a man habitually ſanctified, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſuch ſinne as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calleth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and yet he proues this as he did the former, euen by his owne word. If you will not beleeue him, you muſt goe look proofe other where, but you muſt not looke it in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for if he had brought any, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> would haue giuen it you in Engliſh.</p>
               <p>His next branch is this;</p>
               <p>Where mortall ſinne is committed, God is diſobeyed.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; in this ſentence, he attributeth diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto mortall ſinne adequately, denying veniall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21007:82"/> ſinne to be any diſobedience vnto Gods law: for if he did not ſo, he muſt ſay, that the habit of grace is loſt by the committing of ſuch ſinnes as hee calls veniall: for he ſaith, (as we ſhall ſee anon) where <hi>God is diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, grace cannot conſiſt, but muſt needs be loſt.</hi> But he will not ſay grace is loſt by veniall ſinne; therefore he conceiueth onely mortall ſinne diſobeyeth Gods law. Iuſt as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth: who teacheth,</p>
               <p>Veniall ſinne is ſinne, by analogy, or certaine proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and imperfectly, after a certaine ſort; but not perfectly, and ſimply: neither is it perfectly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, nor perfectly againſt the Law: but beſides the Law. De amiſſ. gra. lib. 1. cap. 11. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If you aske me, how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> proues this? I anſwer, with no worſe proofe then he hath done the former branches: and that is his owne very word, which you need not ſticke at, for he is one of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt in the Church of England.</p>
               <p>His third branch is in theſe words: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p>Where God is diſobeyed he will not abide.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, in what ſenſe ſoeuer the word <hi>diſobeyed</hi> be taken, this ſentence is falſe, and muſt goe for ſuch, till he hath proued it; which yet he hath not done, nor attempted to doe, let him ſhew vs in the diuine Reuelation one of theſe two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1 God hath decreed to take away his grace vpon the committing of this or that ſinne.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2 This actuall ſinne, is of that nature, that of it ſelfe, it doth expell grace.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>If he proue one of theſe, the queſtion is at an end, the Diuine Oracle muſt haue credit. If you bring not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21007:83"/> that, you <hi>hunt a flea, and purſue a ſhadow.</hi> It is in vaine for you to tell vs a <hi>Iuſt man may ſinne,</hi> till you proue, that <hi>grace muſt giue place to ſinne, by the ordinance and decree of God, or the nature of the things themſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be ſome other things in this proofe to be examined: but I paſſe them ouer, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon theſe branches which I haue anſwered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and doe ſtand or fall with them. To conclude this argument, I ſay, It is worthy to be obſerued that the maintainers of falling from grace are raiſed vnto a great pitch of confidence in the truth of that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but at the vpſhot, their proofes are for the thing denyed by none, and they take for granted the things denyed by all; which kind of diſputing, in it ſelfe is moſt vnſound; for it is no more, but as if they ſhould ſay, it is ſo, becauſe we ſay it is ſo, and it is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Reader that is not very wary: for it is moſt deceitfull, bearing a ſhew of truth through the allegation of many places of Scripture, which indeed doe nothing concerne the thing in queſtion.</p>
               <p>It may be, ſome will vrge theſe places of Scripture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> on this ſort.</p>
               <p>If <hi>he that is habitually ſanctified, alwayes may, and ſometimes doth commit ſuch ſinnes, as for which (in in the euent) he is caſt into hell, then a man may loſe, and ſome doe loſe the habit of ſanctity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>he that is habitually ſanctified, alwayes may, and ſometime doth, commit ſuch ſinnes, as for which, in the euent, he is caſt into hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: In this reaſon, I grant the firſt part, or conſequence of the propoſition: becauſe no man
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21007:83"/> hath the habit of ſanctity in the moment when hee goes to hell; for that leades to another end, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be crowned with glory.</p>
               <p>But the aſſumption, or ſecond part, which hath two branches, is wholly falſe: no one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth affirme, or inferre either of theſe two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The habitually ſanctified may commit ſuch ſinnes as for which (in the euent) he ſhall goe to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some habitually ſanctified haue committed ſuch ſins, as for which he is now in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any require me to ſhew, that, the places alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged doe not proue thus much. I anſwer, That is not my office: for, 1. the queſtion is not (at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) purpoſely diſputed. 2, It is their place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and mine to anſwer: let them apply the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the purpoſe in an orderly forme, and I will make my anſwer good. It is enough for mee to giue them an Iſſue. They muſt proue the Iſſue, or leaue the cauſe behind them.</p>
               <p>I will put ſome of their allegations into forme, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> anſwer to them, which I doe thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that may leaue his actuall righteouſneſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch actuall ſinne, as for which hee is threatned by God, in the euent, to be caſt into hell, he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch ſinnes, as for which, in the euent, he ſhall be caſt into hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the man habitually ſanctified may leaue his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſſe, and commit ſuch ſinne, as for which he is threatned by God, in the euent, to be caſt into hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So ſaith Ezech. cap. 18. 24. 26. If the righteous turne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21007:84"/> from his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity, hee ſhall dye therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the man habitually ſanctified, may commit ſuch ſinne, as for which, in the euent, he ſhall goe to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: although the propoſition ſeemes not to be euidently true: becauſe, God may ſo threaten ſin, to ſhew vnto man what the deſert of ſinne is, and not what in the euent ſhall become of ſuch a ſinner: yet I will not at this preſent inſiſt thereupon: but come to the aſſumption, which is not true: neither doth the place alledged make it appeare to be ſo: for theſe three words, viz. <hi>Righteous, Righteouſneſſe, Iniquity,</hi> may import the <hi>act,</hi> and none of them can ſignifie the <hi>habit:</hi> as the text it ſelfe doth euidently ſhew, which doth interpret the word <hi>Righteous,</hi> by the word <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> it calleth an <hi>Act,</hi> ſaying, <hi>all his righteouſneſſe that he hath done, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be replyed, actuall righteouſneſſe, doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the habituall, as the fountaine, from whence it proceedeth, &amp; without which actuall righteouſneſſe cannot be. I anſwer: Actuall righteouſneſſe may proceed from actuall grace, becauſe actuall grace doth make mans will a ſufficient <hi>root or beginning, and an able-next-cauſe of ſupernaturall actions,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>Opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 4. no</hi> 1. and the Councell of Trent hath decreed, Seſſ. 6. cap. 6. where it ſaith, <hi>a man doth beleeue, feare, hope, truſt, loue, deteſt ſinne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a new life, &amp;c.</hi> (all which are ſupernaturall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or actuall righteouſneſſe) <hi>by grace exciting and adjuvating,</hi> which is actuall, not habituall grace.</p>
               <p>If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> will deny this, the Scripture it ſelfe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21007:84"/> will avow it, which ſpeaketh of ſome that <hi>fall away:</hi> which argueth they did righteouſly before time, but now commit ſinne. Of them that fall away it ſaith alſo, they had <hi>taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the life to come;</hi> which two things ſignifie actuall grace. They cannot ſignifie habituall grace, becauſe the beginning of, and preparation vnto our ſanctity, may well be reſembled vnto, and ſet out by <hi>taſting:</hi> which is the beginning and preparation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that feeding which is for ſatisfying of hunger, and nouriſhment of the body. But the habit of grace, which is the higheſt degree and meaſure of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot be ſet out by the metaphor of <hi>taſting.</hi> For the habit is no leſſe then meat receiued into, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the body of man, ſuſtaining his being, and giuing him power to doe the actions of life, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded further: what holy actions doe proceed from the habit of ſanctity? I anſwer, They are ſuch as are done, 1. out of the loue of God, and his Law: 2. out of an intention of, and a delight in obedience to God. 3. They be ſuch holy actions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man doth continue, either alwayes without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, or returne from actuall ſinning by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And the reaſon hereof is good: for (in the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all men) the habit doth diſpoſe a manvnto doing with willingneſſe, readineſſe, and delight: and the habit of ſanctity doth determine the ſoule of man vnto doing the workes of righteouſneſſe, as may be proued againſt ſuch as deny it, with <hi>Suarez Opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 4. no</hi> 1. So as although a man doe the works of righteouſneſs neuer ſo faire in outward appearance,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21007:85"/> neuer ſo many, for number, and continuance: yet, they proceed not from any habit or ſetled inward quality of holineſſe, if they be done for priuate ends, and be wholly diſcontinued at laſt.</p>
               <p>And thus I haue (as I hope) plainly, and truly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and reſolued, the whole difficulty in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and thereby ſhewed it inſufficient to vphold <hi>their falling from grace.</hi> Which being well obſerued, will giue ſatisfaction vnto all other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are alledged in this queſtion.</p>
               <p>In fauour of the ſecond branch of their aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> at <hi>no</hi> 19. They diſpute thus, Gagg p. 164.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas had the habit of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas committed ſinne for which he is in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ſome that had the habit of grace commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin for which he is in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: Hee hath proofes for his propoſition, and aſſumption. This I grant as a thing euident. That I deny as a thing manifeſtly falſe. His proofe for his propoſition is in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Iudas was numbred with the twelue Apoſtles, had all the prerogatiues which they enioyed, God gaue him to Chriſt, as well as Peter, or Iohn.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this proofe is childiſh, the reading of it refuteth him: all theſe things alledged were outward priuiledges, no inward habit of grace. If he conceiue them otherwiſe, he muſt proue it: his word will not make articles of faith: a goodly diſputation, that in concluſion (alwaies) reſteth vpon the diſputers word: you muſt beleeue that, or reſt where you began.</p>
               <p>Other toyes of this kind you may haue enow, in the place where I had this, but it is loath ſome to name them.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:21007:85"/>
               <p>One more I will propound and examine, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> be no doubt remaining. This it is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter had the habit of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter committed ſuch a ſinne as for which he was in the preſent ſtate of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ſome that haue the habit of grace did commit ſuch ſinne as for which he was in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: The whole doubt of this argument, lyeth in the words <hi>ſtate of damnation.</hi> The ſenſe of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly knowne, the argument will bee found good or bad. A man is then in the <hi>ſtate of damnation,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 When hee wanteth that inward quality that muſt order, or ſet him in the way vnto holineſſe in this life, and happineſſe in the life to come.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, when hee ſtandeth actually bound ouer (by God as he is a Iudge) vnto hell fire, for the ſinne committed.</p>
               <p>If it be his intent to ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> was thus in the ſtate of damnation, his aſſumption is falſe, and a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable begging of the queſtion, by affirming vpon his bare authority, a principall thing in queſtion. But if by <hi>ſtate of damnation,</hi> he meant; the deſert of ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then I grant the whole: but the concluſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe; we ſpeake not of the deſert of ſinne in it ſelfe, but of damnation it ſelfe actually in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. To conclude my anſwer to all the arguments of this kinde: Now we ſee he beateth the buſh, and maketh offer to take the game: but hee wanteth all meanes for the purpoſe, the fowle muſt come into his fiſt, or he muſt goe without her.</p>
               <p>His other argument for the maine queſtion I finde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:21007:86"/> written, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 161. which is to this effect,</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Lucifer</hi> did loſe their originall ſtate, then man may loſe his habit of grace: for the one was in the ſtate of innocency in Paradiſe: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen in glory: to whom man in grace (at moſt) is but equall, not ſuperiour.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Lucifer</hi> did loſe their originall ſtate.</p>
               <p>Therefore man may loſe his habit of grace.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this argument is as ſhallow and ſhuttle, as any of the former; the weakeneſſe of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is ſeene by a peece of an eye: All men will grant, the prouidence of GOD in this or that act, is not regulated by the former act of his prouidence. What if he did ſo to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> could he not doe otherwiſe with other men? what is there in the nature of the things themſelues, or of GOD, that ſhould tye him to doe in this as he did in that? ſurely nothing. His actions towards the creatures were all free, and hee at liberty to doe, or not doe, this waies, or that waies, as he pleaſed; vntill hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed what, and how he would doe. He doth <hi>all things according to the counſell of his owne will;</hi> that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Suarez</hi> doth truely interpret it, <hi>opuſc. 4. diſp. 1. ſect. 1. no</hi> 9. <hi>God worketh all things according to that counſell which is accepted by the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> this is ſure, God did ſo by them, and wee beleeue it, becauſe he hath ſaid it; that he doth ſo by other men, we beleeue not, becauſe God hath not ſaid it. Wee know ſome men are in the poſſeſſion of the habit of grace; if you will haue vs beleeue this poſſeſſion to be caſuall, ſhew vs where God hath ſaid, hee will take it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21007:86"/> away, elſe wee dare not beleeue you: for it is plaine, none can take it away but God: and he will not take it away, vnleſſe hee hath reuealed ſo much vnto vs, which he hath not done: and ſo much for all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from Scripture.</p>
               <p>He vrgeth Fathers, with no leſſe confidence of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> and plainneſſe, for him: pretending alſo, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Church <hi>commanding all men to receiue their teſtimony,</hi> Appeale, page 36. and 37. He bringeth ſome by name, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 165. &amp;c. But this is a very bubble, and comes from that foyſting fountaine, that the reſt of his brags haue done. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath no ſuch confidence in the Fathers: hee nameth but two, and out of each of them, one ſentence, and ſo ſitteth him downe; which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would neuer haue done, if he could haue found more. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu</hi> will ſay, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is <hi>a poore Ignaro, and hath no old learning, himſelfe hath read more Fathers then Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine euer heard of,</hi> which is his owne language in another caſe; all the world would laugh at him: but not beleeue him. The concluſion is, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brags nor brings, therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> doth both in vaine.</p>
               <p>I will finiſh my anſwer to his Fathers by his owne direction, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 165.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There needs no proofe by Fathers, where holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent: Fathers may be pretended by falſe play, but none (indeed and in truth according to their words and meaning</hi>) can be produced. Let him try when he will, in a Logicall forme, and he ſhall finde it. Thus haue I concluded my anſwers to all his arguments brought to proue his <hi>falling from grace,</hi> taken from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21007:87"/> and Fathers.</p>
               <p>His laſt argument for the ſame purpoſe, I finde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> 
                  <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 17. which he beginneth thus,</p>
               <p>If you deny falling from grace, you are a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this ſentence beginneth an argument, which is continued by diuers other parts which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It is called a <hi>delemma,</hi> in plaine Engliſh, a Net, a Snare, a Toyle, to catch the old one; the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell is before and behinde, turne you which waies you will, it will catch you. But ſoft and faire, <hi>old Birds will not be caught with chaffe,</hi> if the ſtuffe of your Net be vnſound, your game will eſcape.</p>
               <p>This ſentence doth neither affirme nor deny, put it into a lawfull forme; and it ſpeaketh thus;</p>
               <p>He that denyeth falling from grace, is a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>This ſentence is falſe: for falling from grace is an Article of the Popiſh faith, as himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 158. and I haue proued by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent: cap.</hi> 11. The denyall of the Popiſh faith cannot argue a man to be a Papiſt, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any man liuing. Hee is a ſtrange Papiſt, that treads the faith of Papiſts vnder his feete; but more ſtrange that a man ſhould be a Papiſt for denying the Popiſh faith. Well, but he will proue it by the words which follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I demand, did Peter fall, or did he not fall, when he denyed Chriſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; euery interrogation hath the force of an affirmation; now this is referred as a proofe vnto the precedent ſentence, by the word <hi>for:</hi> which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow the ſame; thus then hee doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:21007:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter did either fall, or not fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore hee that denieth falling from grace, is a Papiſt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I anſwer; this leaueth the matter no leſſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then it was: this giueth vs leaue to ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it did not inforce a fall.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Therefore he did fall.</hi>

               <p>When you haue ſaid all, you haue ſaid nothing. It may be the next will diſpatch the matter. You ſay,</p>
               <p>If he fall, he needes muſt fall totally, or finally: for ſhew me a third?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; <hi>this is faire, but farre off;</hi> whither this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, none but your ſelfe knowes, if your ſelfe doe know, you ſhall be crowned for a choyce one.

               <p>You muſt anſwer he did not fall.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; and ſo muſt you too; or be a rebell againſt your Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which in the firſt Sermon of Repentance, a little before the end: where (after it had reckoned vp <hi>Peters</hi> denyall of his Maſter, and diſſimulation at <hi>Antioch</hi>) it concludeth:</p>

I doubt not but <hi>Peter</hi> did in the inward motion of his heart, beleeue that hee was indeed the Chriſt; and truſted vnto, and relyed vpon him, as ſuch: euen in that very moment when in words he denyed that he knew him. <hi>Peters</hi> deniall being but a diſſimulation to thruſt by the preſent diſtreſſe hee feared. If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Gagger ſay thus, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them, and that vpon good reaſon: for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had long beleeued on Chriſt, and had now no cauſe to change that beleefe, therefore wee may not ſay he did change it; vnleſſe the diuine reuelation had ſaid it, which hath not a word of any ſuch thing, but looke better on your bookes, and you ſhall find <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſaith; <hi>Peter loſt his charity, but not his faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was Paſtor ouer the whole Church, and was to teach it the true faith, de Pont. Rom lib. 4. cap.</hi> 3. which ſentence is much more then I ſay: by which it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine is not the <hi>perſeuerance I maintaine:</hi> nor my <hi>ſentence ſo good Popery,</hi> as M. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> hath deliuered, contrary to his vniuſt challenge, <hi>Appeale pag.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>It may be he will deny my diſtinction of the act of faith; to eſtabliſh his owne implyed, <hi>Gagg. pag.</hi> 163. which is on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith is</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But this diſtinction I feare not; becauſe <hi>end</hi> and <hi>act</hi> are not parts of <hi>faith;</hi> neither as ſpecialls, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, nor as conſtitutiue parts, making a conſtituted whole: beſides, what he ſaith, of the end of faith, is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21007:89"/> riddle which (I doubt) himſelfe vnderſtandeth not: Thus farre haue I anſwered to the conſequent, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as it lyeth; I will now put the diſputation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> due forme, and anſwer thereunto.</p>
               <p>Thus then it lyeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you ſay</hi> Peter <hi>loſt not his habit of grace, then you ſubſcribe to</hi> Bellarmine <hi>and the Gagger: who ſay, that,</hi> Peter <hi>loſt not his faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will not ſubſcribe to</hi> Bellarmine, &amp;c. <hi>where he ſaith,</hi> Peter <hi>loſt not his faith: for that is Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore you muſt not deny, that Peter loſt his habit of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; This whole argument is a meere caption, and no proofe: it ſuppoſeth, that, the loſſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace, is denyed to <hi>Peter</hi> onely; which is falſe: and the concluſion nothing to the purpoſe. And ſo he muſt be vnderſtood, for the Papiſts deny the loſſe of faith vnto <hi>Peter</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>But I will take it as it lyeth, and anſwer to it. The weakneſſe of his cauſe will the better appeare by my anſwer, which is this;</p>
               <p>I grant the aſſumption, I promiſe you, I am, and will be as farre off from ioyning in that article of the Popiſh faith, as M. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> and further too. For he comes very neere it in giuing the Church the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to determine all controuerſies in faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet you get nothing by it; for the conſequence of your propoſition is naught, I may ſay the firſt and not the ſecond, in the ſenſe wherein they take it; for they ſay <hi>he loſt not his faith, neither in the habit, nor act, by a ſpeciall prouidence, and peculiar diſpenſation:</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:21007:90"/> vpon the reaſon, and for the end, as is aforeſaid, <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 25. but, I ſay, hee loſt it not, neither in habit, nor act, by that prouidence and diſpenſation, which is common to him with all other men that haue receiued the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace; who muſt needs keepe their faith ſo long as they keepe the habit of grace; becauſe the habit of grace conſiſteth in faith, hope and charitie. Vnto this ſentence of mine that faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is contrary. They ſay, <hi>all men loſe their faith, when they loſe the habit of grace,</hi> (onely <hi>Peter</hi> is excepted, by a peculiar priuiledge as I haue ſhewed, <hi>no</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Thus are we come to an end of M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his ſnare, and we find the ſnare is broken, and the game is eſcaped, and with it, his whole diſputation in this point of falling from grace is ended. Hee tells vs of ſome that <hi>haue whirlegiggs in their heads,</hi> Appeale, pag. 81. Which is true of himſelfe, if it be true of any, but he may bee pardoned that fault, his heart was ſo full of anger, and his pen of railing, that he had no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend vpon Art and Diuinitie.</p>

               <p>His conſent with the Church of Rome is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> witneſſed by himſelfe. Thus he writeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no difference betweene the Church of Rome, and ours, in the point of Reall preſence.</hi> Gagg. p. 253.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Proteſtant in the Sacrament, is as reall and ſubſtantiall as any Papiſt.</hi> Gagg. p. 251.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Prieſts and Ieſuits, were not common Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retters of Chriſtendome for priuate ends, this controuerſie on foot, touching the reall preſence, might ceaſe.</hi> Gagg. p. 251.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that in the point of reall preſence, doe make a difference betweene vs, and the Papiſts, were bred vp by the deuill in a faction, and by him brought vp in a faction, and by him ſent abroad to doe him ſeruice, in maintaining a faction.</hi> Gagg. p. 253. and Appeale p. 291.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The onely difference, betweene the Church of Rome, and ours, is about the manner.</hi> Appeale
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21007:91"/> p. 289. viz. <hi>How it is made the fleſh of Chriſt.</hi> Gagg. p. 256. 255. <hi>Namely, whether by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation or not. 252. 254. The Councell of Lateran decreed Tranſubſtantiation, which wee condemne.</hi> Gagg. p. 252.</p>
               <p>And in this, <hi>viz.</hi> how it is made the fleſh of Chriſt, he placeth the whole difference between the Church of Rome, and ours, blaming them for this, p. 252. and for nothing elſe; and reprouing their proofes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proue not that <hi>the ſacrament is the fleſh of Chriſt by tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Gagg. p. 252. and 254. Out of which, wee may conclude: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> beleeueth, as the Councell of Trent hath decreed, touching the reall preſence: and the doctrine of it is his doctrine; ſo as, what the Councell ſaith of <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, carying about,</hi> and <hi>worſhipping of the Sacrament,</hi> muſt be accounted the faith of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt doth neceſſarily inferre the ſecond. If Chriſt be really preſent, then the ſacrament, muſt bee ſo reſerued, caryed, worſhipped. And ſo much for the ſecond branch.</p>
               <p>If this be true, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the Church of England in the point of reall preſence. To the end hee might perſwade vs that hee doth not diſſent from the Church of England, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, Appeale p. 289. <hi>The point of reall preſence is not Popery in the diuinity of the Church of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> That is, the Church of England, agreeth with the Church of Rome, in the point of reall preſence: as he doth explicate himſelfe a few lines after. If that be ſo, then I grant he doth not diſſent from the Church of England.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:21007:92"/>
               <p>But all the doubt will be, how he will proue, that the Church of England doth ioyne in faith, with the Church of Rome in the point of reall preſence. His proofe (ſuch as it is) I find ſet downe, <hi>Appeale p.</hi> 289. &amp;c. and may be concluded in this forme;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer is taught by the Biſhops; Bilſon, Andrewes, Morton: by Proteſtants; Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Caluin, Beza<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sadael, is the doctrine of the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the faith of the Church of Rome, touching the reall preſence, is taught by theſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, the faith of the Church of Rome, in the point of reall preſence, is the doctrine of the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This forme of diſputing may not bee excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, becauſe all his allegations in the place quoted, will be to no purpoſe, if he doth not thus diſpute; for the allegations doe ſerue to proue this aſſumption, or can be of no vſe at this time.</p>
               <p>To the propoſition I anſwer two things. Firſt, The doctrine of the Church of England is contained in bookes, authoriſed publikely for that end, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto as ſuch. But theſe mens writings are not ſuch: For no ſtatute, law, or ordinance, haue ratified them: and commanded ſubſcription vnto them as ſuch. Therefore your propoſition is falſe. Secondly, your owne words are theſe, Appeale. p. 58. and 59.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas you would make the world beleeue that Eccleſia Anglicana Calviniſtat, as if hee were the father and founder of our faith, as if our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe were to be pinned vnto his ſleeue, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to bee taught after his inſtitutions: ſhew
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21007:92"/> me good warrant for it, and I yeeld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is impoſſible, therefore your propoſition is falſe, euen by your owne ſentence: his owne pen gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Iudgement againſt his propoſition as falſe: that being falſe, this reaſon cannot be good, although his aſſumption were neuer ſo true.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is vtterly falſe; and I doe admire, that ſhame did not with-hold him, from alleadging <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> as conſenters vnto the Romiſh faith in the point of reall preſence; ſeeing that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt Booke and firſt Chapter of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt doth make <hi>Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall oppoſers thereunto: and in the ſecond Chapter he doth apply the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in ſpeciall ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> and forgetteth him not, in no one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his diſputations in this point.</p>
               <p>The words of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> (euen as he hath allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them) are not ſo much as like vnto the Romiſh faith, as hee that readeth them will preſently iudge. I doe not attempt to apply them to his aſſumption. Two of them are yet liuing, who will (I doubt not) by liuely voyce, diſclaime the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and their conſent thereto, touching the reall preſence, and ſo fully refute his aſſumption as falſe.</p>
               <p>He inferreth further from hence, on this wiſe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this be the Doctrine that the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>teacheth and profeſſeth, (as it is indeed) I leaue you to thoſe that muſt looke vnto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; this inference preſumes too farre, and comes too late, I may rather inferre contrariwiſe.</p>
               <p>If the Romiſh faith of reall preſence bee not the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21007:93"/> Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not) my anſwer hath ſhewed it in part, (and I will ſhew it to the full hereafter,) then I leaue you as a corrupter of our faith, to be puniſhed as ſuch, according to law in that caſe prouided.</p>
               <p>I finde in his <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 250. he writeth thus, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p>Our Catechiſme in the Communion Booke ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, the body and blood of Chriſt is taken and eaten in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>And a few lines after he concludeth in theſe words,</p>
               <p>The Proteſtant is as reall and ſubſtantiall, as any Papiſt.</p>
               <p>He ſeemeth to inferre the latter ſentence vpon the former: the meaning whereof is this: <hi>Proteſtants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the reall and ſubſtantiall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, no leſſe then Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What his intent was, is beſt knowne to himſelfe. It was needfull for mee to propound it, and let it bee knowne by my anſwer thereto, that no <hi>reall preſence</hi> is intended by our Church in the words alleadged: which anſwer I will take from Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> who hath already made it for mee, in his reply vnto <hi>Hardings</hi> anſwere, <hi>Artic. 5. p.</hi> 238. whoſe words be theſe;</p>
               <p>Chriſts body and blood, indeed, and verily, is giuen vnto vs, that we verily eate it, that wee verily drinke it.</p>
               <p>In theſe words there is as much contained, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> alleadgeth out of the Catechiſme. But marke now what he denieth, and anſwereth further for the explication thereof.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:21007:93"/>
               <p>Yet we ſay not, that Chriſts body is let downe from heauen, or made really, or fleſhly preſent in the Sacrament: wee lift vp our hearts to heauen, and there feed vpon the Lambe of God: thus ſpiritually and with the mouth of our faith, wee eate the body of Chriſt, and drinke his blood, euen as verily as his body was verily broken, and his blood verily ſhed vpon the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>This anſwer of Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> is full to the purpoſe, and of no leſſe authority, then the Catechiſme allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: which being taken in this ſenſe, we may ſafely conclude, that our Church is no friend to the reall preſence in thoſe words of the Catechiſme.</p>
               <p>A third thing alſo is in his <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 291. thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſet downe;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both wee, and the Papiſts confeſſe, This is my Body; and that is enough; and contend meerely about the manner how it is my Body,</hi> (that is) <hi>how the Sacrament is made the fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> Gagge, page 256. <hi>The councell of</hi> Lateran <hi>decreed tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and wee deny the ſame,</hi> Gagge, page 252.</p>
               <p>Which ſentence, by the courſe of the place where it is, muſt be applyed to the preſent purpoſe, in this forme;</p>

                  <hi>But we and the Papiſts agree in this ſentence: This is my Body, and contend meerely about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is made the fleſh of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>That it was his purpoſe thus to diſpute, the place it ſelfe where that ſentence ſtandeth, will ſhew: where hee bringeth the thing here concluded in the firſt place, and then the words alleadged, as a proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and referred thereunto, by this word, <hi>ſeeing, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Indeed the queſtion betweene vs this day, is not of the letters or ſyllables of Chriſts words: (for they are knowne and confeſſed of either partie:) But onely of the ſenſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This anſwer is full to euery point of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his argument.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, they agree in words, touching this ſentence, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> and ſo farre hee grants the aſſumption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the queſtion is, of the ſenſe of thoſe words: and thereby denies the aſſumption, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition too: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>although they agree in words: yet differing in the ſenſe, there is ſufficient cauſe of diſtraction, and diſſent betweene them.</hi> For
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21007:94"/> the ſenſe is the <hi>pith of the Scriptures; and hee that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the meaning, corrupteth the Law.</hi> 3 He ſaith they vnderſtand Chriſts words of a <hi>real and fleſhly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body.</hi> Which the Biſhop denyeth, whereby it is euident that he putteth the difference betweene the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and ours in this; <hi>viz.</hi> that They affirme a <hi>reall preſence,</hi> We deny it. And this doth directly oppoſe the latter part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> his reaſon, that placeth the difference betweene them, and vs, meerly <hi>in the manner how the Sacrament is made the fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> which they ſay is by <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi> The Biſhop ſaith, <hi>we diſſent about the reall preſence.</hi> M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſaith no: for (ſaith he) our diſſent is meerly about tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>By which it appeareth, M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his arguments (in the behalfe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) were anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long before he was borne.</p>
               <p>It may be he will reply to this anſwer of the Biſhop, that it is not ſufficient, and giue the reaſon for it, which he alleadgeth in the like caſe in his <hi>Appeale pag. 291. viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Devill bred him vp in a faction, and ſent him abroad, to doe him ſeruice in maintaining a faction.</p>
               <p>And thus hee muſt reply, or blot out of both his bookes that bitter ſentence, which was written againſt all ſuch, as make any difference betweene the Romiſh Church, and ours, in the point of reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I reioyne to it in the Biſhops words, <hi>p.</hi> 237.</p>
               <p>If he be of God, he knoweth well, he ſhould not thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his tongue and hand.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if he hath the vnderſtanding of a man, he knoweth it is euidence of truth, not bitterneſſe of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21007:95"/> rayling that carieth credit in a diuinitie queſtion: let him firſt take away the Biſhops proofes, and ſhew wherein hee is a lyar, or an ignorant man, and then there may be ſome excuſe for this railing: till then, it will be held a ruled caſe, <hi>his will was good, but his cauſe nought.</hi> He muſt raile becauſe hee had nothing elſe to ſay. And with this I conclude all the pretences that he hath for his agreement in the point of reall preſence with the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now deliuer ſome reaſons to proue, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Church of <hi>England</hi> doth oppoſe the church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the point of reall preſence, as followeth.</p>
               <p>1 Many of our nation haue giuen their bodies to the fire for denying it. 2 It hath beene proclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, by our Miniſters, without any blame from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or knowne oppoſition from any of ours. 3 Our Church hath determined what is to bee held, touching the nature, and effects of this Sacrament, and hath not a word of the <hi>reall preſence.</hi> Our Church hath determined, that the Sacrament is to be eaten, taken, and giuen, <hi>only after a ſpirituall manner, and by faith:</hi> and denyeth worſhip to it. <hi>Arti. 28. That the wicked receiue the ſigne, but are not partakers of Chriſt. Arti. 29. That it ought to be adminiſtred to all men in both kinds, Arti.</hi> 30. which it would not haue done if it had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Popiſh reall preſence. Laſtly, Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> in the name and defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth it; and maintaineth that that Article of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith is erroneous, firſt in his Apologie begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Chapter 12 the 2 Part and ſo forward, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in his Reply to <hi>Harding, Arti.</hi> 5. And this I hope is ſufficient to proue, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21007:95"/> the popiſh reall preſence.</p>
               <p>It remaineth in the third place, that wee examine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> whether the popiſh reall preſence be true or not: but of that I find nothing in him: it was meet for him to haue proued it before he had pronounced the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof were bred <hi>by the Deuill,</hi> as he doth in the words which I haue alleaged. That he proued it not in his Gagge it is no meruaile: for there he goes hand in hand, with his Aduerſary. That he did it not in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,</hi> was, becauſe, hee could not: for there hee had good cauſe to ſhew all his ſtrength: Onely I find in his <hi>Gagge pag.</hi> 250. theſe words:</p>
               <p>Hee gaue ſubſtance, and really ſubſiſting eſſence, who ſaid, This is my body, this is my blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are little other then a riddle: yet I will make the beſt of them. My anſwer thereunto will explicate the matter, and take away that which might ſeeme to fortifie the popiſh reall preſence: thus it may be framed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt gaue ſubſtance, and an eſsence really ſubſiſting, when he did adminiſter the ſacrament to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and ſaid, This is my body, &amp;c. then the body of Chriſt is really and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſt gaue ſubſtance, and an eſſence really ſubſiſting, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the body of Chriſt is really preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; The word <hi>ſubſtance &amp;c.</hi> in this place may be taken for the ſubſtance of Bread and wine: or for the ſubſtance of Chriſts body: That Chriſt gaue the ſubſtance of bread and wine I grant, and ſo the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true, and hee muſt grant it likewiſe, or elſe ſay
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21007:96"/> with the Councell of <hi>Trent, Seſs. 13. can. 2. That, it doth not remaine: but is changed, &amp;c.</hi> which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he will not doe: But the word <hi>ſubſtance</hi> being thus vnderſtood, he muſt thus argue, Hee gaue the ſubſtance of bread, therefore the ſubſtance of his body was preſent. Theſe two doe hang together <hi>like harpe and Harrow,</hi> ſo the conſequence of the propoſition is naught.</p>
               <p>If by the word <hi>ſubſtance</hi> hee meant Chriſts body, then the ſubſtance of his body is affirmed to be giuen, but not explicated how hee gaue it, nor proued yet that he gaue it. This is his old vaine, you muſt go ſeeke his meaning for the ſenſe, and take his word for the truth, or elſe his is <hi>no man of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will beſtow ſome paines to finde out both: To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                  <hi>giue</hi> may be after an humane ſort (that is) when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer a thing in my poſſeſſion, into the poſſeſſion of another: I had it then, another hath it now: hee is ſeized, I am diſpoſſeſſed of it. If Chriſt gaue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his body thus, then the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubſtance of his body was preſent. But Chriſt did not giue the ſubſtance of his body on this manner. If hee will ſay Chriſt gaue the ſubſtance of his body in this ſort, hee muſt proue it by the word of God; for it is impoſſible vnto naturall vnderſtanding, that Chriſt ſhould deliuer the ſubſtance of his owne body, out of his owne poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the poſſeſſion of his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Giuing</hi> may be after an heauenly and ſpirituall manner, that is to ſay, vnto faith. If he ſay Chriſt gaue the ſubſtance of his body in this ſenſe; Then he ſaith true, and thus he muſt ſay, or diſclaime the faith of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for ſo ſaith our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21007:96"/> Church, in the 28 Article. But then Chriſt might ſo giue, and yet not be really and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament. For we <hi>lift vp our hearts to heauen, and there feed vpon the Lambe of God. Thus ſpiritually, with the mouth of our faith, we eate the body of Chriſt, and drinke his blood, &amp;c.</hi> as I haue alledged out of Biſhop <hi>Iewel</hi> in his reply to <hi>Harding,</hi> p. 238. ſee De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen. Apolog. p. 234. and 264. for this anſwer.</p>
               <p>I hope no man will require mee to proue, that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Chriſt is not really preſent in the Sacrament: that belongs not to me: but becauſe they affirme that hee is preſent, and tels vs we muſt beleeue, that God hath reuealed it; therefore it is enough for vs to call for a ſight of that diuine reuelation, and in the meane time to with-hold our beleefe thereof, euen vpon that ground which Biſhop <hi>Iewel</hi> hath laid in the defence of his Apology, part 2. cap. 12. diuiſ. 1. p. 220. namely,</p>
               <p>Chriſt nor his Apoſtles neuer taught, nor the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church neuer beleeued that reall preſence.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I ended this argument, and the whole point of reall preſence, and (I hope) haue made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that it is, neither the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor a true doctrine.</p>

               <p>If this word <hi>your</hi> be added vnto the words <hi>practice, and doctrine,</hi> and the word <hi>then</hi> bee put before the words <hi>we agree,</hi> then that ſentence may bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: but he will not abide him that ſhall doe ſo, for he rageth againſt him that ſhall doe ſo, <hi>Appeale. p.</hi> 256. &amp;c. Whether thoſe words be added or no, his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Church of Rome, doth ſufficiently ſhew it ſelfe in them: for, 1. theſe words are ſpoken vnto the Church of Rome, with whom he hath this preſent diſputation: for in the former part of this diſcourſe he ſaith vnto them, <hi>Whatſoeuer you ſay, &amp;c. In your practice, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is all one, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Let your practice and doctrine goe together, &amp;c.</hi> 2. By <hi>doctrine</hi> hee meaneth all the doctrine of their Church; for he ſpeaketh of doctrine without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby extendeth his agreement with them in their whole doctrine touching Images: which is further confirmed by ſaying, <hi>the queſtion betweene him and them is not what may be giuen them.</hi> Which is as much as if he ſaid, I conſent vnto their whole doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. 3. By the <hi>doctrine</hi> of their Church, he muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the decree of the Councell of Trent: for their Church hath no other doctrine but that: the reſt is opinions of ſingular men: ſo that his ſentence now ſet downe, is as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>I agree with the Councell of Trent in the point of Images.</p>
               <p>Now the Councell of Trent hath decreed in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21007:99"/> place alledged; that,</p>
               <p>The honour to bee giuen to Images, is kiſsing of them, vncouering the head, and bowing downe before them.</p>
               <p>Which muſt be vnderſtood to be M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> his ſentence alſo.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this plaine euidence, yet I preſume he will deny his agreement with the Church of Rome: becauſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ignorant amongst them giue them honour due vnto God, and the learned amongst them (as</hi> Thomas <hi>by name, and others with him) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that as much honour is to bee giuen to a woodden Crucifix, as to Chriſt himſelfe in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thus he writeth, and in this hee putteth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene himſelfe and them, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 299. and 319.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; this is not ſufficient to excuſe him from agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alleadged is matter of fact: and hath not to doe in this buſineſſe, which concernes onely the faith of their Church; the other which is the ſentence of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> is matter of opinion, which the Councell hath not decreed: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 20. there be three opinions in their Church touching this thing:</hi> whereof this of <hi>Thomas</hi> is but one; ſo that we may conclude, hee differeth from them in one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held by ſome amongſt them: and this is all hee ſaith; and therefore for all this hee conſenteth with them in matter of faith, which is the thing wee ſeeke for.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:21007:99"/>
               <p>I anſwer further; It doth not appeare, that hee doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> diſſent from them in this opinion neither. For he <hi>yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth honour vnto Images,</hi> Gagge, page 318. but, doth not ſhew vs what is the nature thereof, whereby wee might bee able to diſcerne the difference of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he giues, from that which they giue.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, the Councell giueth little honour to Images, and that which <hi>Thomas</hi> giueth is the main and chiefe thing to be blamed. I anſwer; that honour which the Councell giueth, is falſely giuen, and is a matter of faith, which we may not receiue: for euery <hi>falſe faith is an addition to the diuine reuelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you aske, whether hee agreeth with the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of <hi>England,</hi> or not: Hee will anſwer, he doth agree with it, and doth affirme ſo much in effect, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 318. 319. but it is a meere pretence without ſhew of truth: hee can alleadge no one paſſage in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that any Images of Chriſt and the Saints ſhould be ſet vp in Churches, or that any kinde of honour ſhould be done vnto them, being ſet vp there: or, which aſſigneth vnto them any vſe in religion: much leſſe, that they ſhould be <hi>helpes of piety, &amp;c.</hi> The caſe being ſuch, it was a face without a face, that ſaid, <hi>wee and Proteſtants doe them all,</hi> Gagge, page 318.</p>
               <p>The very truth is, he doth contradict the Doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in ſome of theſe poſitions directly, and in other ſome by neceſſary conſequence, and I proue it thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Doctrine concluded and vrged in the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. For,</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:21007:100"/>
               <p>The Booke it ſelfe, and the vſe thereof, is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by publike authority, and the ſubſcription of all Miniſters, <hi>Artic.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he doth contradict the Doctrine concluded and vrged in the Homilies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore he doth contradict, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aſſumption or ſecond part, will bee apparent to him, that readeth the words on both ſides, ſet downe in the former Chapter. It ſaith, <hi>Idoll and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is the ſame thing:</hi> and alleadgeth the vſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it. He ſaith, <hi>Image and Idoll may be two things,</hi> that is, are not one; It ſaith, <hi>Images may not be brought into Churches, and that being there, they bee vnlawfull, and intollerable:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>they may bee brought into Churches, they are not vnlawfull, and are ſometimes profitable:</hi> all which are direct contradictions: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, what it denieth, and denying what it affirmeth. Laſtly, if Images may not be brought into Churches, then may they not be imployed in religion, <hi>for helpes of piety, the inſtruction of the ignorant, and the ſtirring vp of deuotion, &amp;c.</hi> for theſe are more then that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Images in Churches may bee for ornament, or for no vſe. The Homilie doth deny the placing of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in Churches, therefore it muſt alſo deny them to be helpes vnto piety, &amp;c. now he teacheth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to this, in making Images <hi>helpes vnto piety:</hi> therefore hee doth contradict that which followeth vpon the words of the Homilie, by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Let vs ſee how he will auoid this obiection, and for that end, thus he ſaith, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 260.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I admit the Homilies to containe godly exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>but not as the publike dogmaticall reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21007:100"/> of our Church, or Doctrine to bee propugned and ſubſcribed in all and euery point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; in the 12. Chapter, <hi>no</hi> 8. hee extold the Doctrine of the Homilie, as <hi>an authenticall record of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. In this place he denies them to <hi>containe the dogmaticall reſolutions of our Church,</hi> (ſo conſtant is hee, and ſo ſettled in his iudgement.) Let vs take what he will admit; which we finde to be three things: firſt, they are <hi>exhortations;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>godly;</hi> thirdly, <hi>To bee propugned and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in ſome things.</hi> I require no more: <hi>Exhortations</hi> they are, (that is) matters of manners, all of them are not matters of faith, and therefore they doe not all containe reſolutions of faith: but ſome of them bee matters of manners. He grants them to be <hi>godly,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true, for falſhood cannot tend to godlineſſe. They are <hi>ſubſcribed,</hi> in ſome things, therefore in this that I haue alleadged; becauſe it is not <hi>a rhetoricall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, nor a Tropicall kinde of ſpeech, but the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enforced;</hi> which is ſet downe in words that haue no other ſenſe but as they lie, without interpretation. This is enough to proue my propoſition, and thus I diſpute from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euery exhortation propounded, inforced, eſteemed godly, commanded to be ſubſcribed vnto by our Church, is the Doctrine of our Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Doctrine of the Homilie alleadged, cap. 15, is an exhortation propounded, inforced, &amp;c. by our Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Doctrine of the Homilie alleadged, cap. 15. is the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:21007:101"/>
               <p>Thus hee confirmeth the obiection which hee is deſirous to thruſt off: <hi>The ſight of truth may bee hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the being of truth cannot be defeated: hee that attempteth to conceale it, in the euent makes it more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to ſee what truth there is in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> touching Images: but I finde no proofe for that. It may be hee expecteth arguments to proue, that Images in Churches are vnlawfull: and that no honor is to be giuen vnto them, but that ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly: for hee that will haue vs beleeue that wee are bound to giue honour to Images by the diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, ought to ſhew vs record for it: and mee thinkes it had beene comely for him to haue borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proofes from <hi>Bellarmine, de Relig. Sanct. lib. 2. cap. 7. 8. 9. 10. and</hi> 11. 12. As well as hee fetched poſitions from the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> To anſwer <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is but labour loſt: for I know not how farre hee will ioyne with him in his proofes, and it would be too tedious; for he brings much more then will ſort with this occaſion, and preſent buſineſſe. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> vrge what he liketh beſt, and hee ſhall haue anſwer: till then, I reſt ſatisfied with the Homilie, that diſputeth thus againſt Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 If the worſhipping of Images doe alwaies befall Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſet vp in Churches, then it is vnlawfull to ſet vp Images in Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the firſt is true, perpetuall experience doth ſhew it: and the affinity that is betweene mans corruption, and the worſhipping of Images doth procure it,</hi> pag. 128.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:21007:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the laſt is true alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>That thing which is vſed in order vnto ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions, and is not warrantd in the diuine reuelation for that end, is vnlawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Images in Churches are ſo vſed, and are not warranted &amp;c.</hi> pag. 88.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore Images in Churches be vnlawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſay theſe are rhetoricall en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forcements, and no <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land;</hi> I will ſaue him that labour. I doe alleage thoſe arguments for the truth that is in them; not for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that doth commend them. Let him ſhew wherein they be vntrue, or confeſſe they are true, and it ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>But he is not able to ſhew this, and therefore wee may ſafely conclude; this man was ſtrangely tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he wrote on this manner, &amp; in theſe words;</p>
               <p>If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had giuen no more to Images but an hiſtoricall vſe, our Church would not haue departed from them about that point (as I ſuppoſe) for ſo our doctrine is, <hi>Appeale, p. 251.</hi> Our ſtricteſt writers doe not condemne it, <hi>p. 253.</hi> Furious ones in our Church would proceed, but they are ſingular illuminates, let them gang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; what the doctine of our Church is, in this point of Images, I haue declared in the foregoing Chapter. If you can bring any record, for any other paſſage in the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that putteth vpon Images this hiſtoricall vſe, namely of <hi>ſuggeſting vnto, mouing,</hi> or <hi>affecting the mind, euen in pious, and religious affections,</hi> which you father vpon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21007:102"/> it, <hi>p.</hi> 253. you may doe well to bring it forth, that, the world may ſee it. But becauſe you cannot, I muſt intreat you to take the words of Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> vnto <hi>Harding</hi> in the defence of his Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 350 without offence; which are as followeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leaue, leaue this hypocriſie, diſſemble no more, it is not manly: your credit faileth ouermuch, your word is no ſufficient warrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you will fall into your wonted fury, it is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that muſt beare it; They are his words not mine and vttered vpon the like occaſion that you offer here. I could adde a farther refutation, and pull off this falſe imputation from the ſhoulders of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Iewell;</hi> but I defer it vnto the next paſſage, where the reader ſhall find it.</p>
               <p>He wanted proofes for his doctrine of Images: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> hee will make amends by his confident affirmation thereof, and negation of the contrary: For thus hee writeth:</p>
               <p>There is no Popery in the hiſtoricall vſe of Images,</p>
               <p>Appeale, pag. 252.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; There is Popery in it: for it is the faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I haue ſhewed in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter going before: and it is contrary to the word of God, as I will ſhew anon; both which are ſufficient to make it Popery, euen in your owne iudgement: for thus you write,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popery is contrary to the word of God,</hi> Appeal. p. 310.</p>
               <p>But he doth deny that this vſe of Images is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the word of God: for thus he writeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 The hiſtoricall vſe of Images, is true doctrine in it ſelfe,</hi> Appeale, p. 251.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:21007:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 That Images may be made, for ornament, memory, hiſtory, no law of God forbiddeth,</hi> Appeale, p. 265.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> is a witneſſe ſo competent, to ſhew vs what is true, or not true; what is forbidden or not forbidden in this caſe, that I ſhall need to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none but him. Thus he writeth in his anſwer to <hi>Harding</hi> the 14 Article, p. 378. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 The firſt end of Images is, the attaining of knowledge, although perhaps ſomewhat may bee learned by them; yet is not this the ordinary way appointed by God to attaine knowledge.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul ſaith, faith commeth by hearing, not by gazing. This ſeemeth to be no handſome way for to teach the people, for where greateſt ſtore of ſuch Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be, there the people are moſt ignorant, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtious, and ſubiect to Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>I grant Images do oftentimes vehemently moue the mind, but euery thing that may moue the mind, is not meet for the Church of God. Gods houſe is a houſe of prayer, not of gazing. Whoeuer ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or maketh his prayer beholding an Image, is ſo moued in his mind, that hee thinketh the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage heareth him, and hopeth it will performe his prayer.</hi> Alleadged out of S. <hi>Auguſtin, p.</hi> 318.</p>
               <p>3 Touching <hi>remembrance</hi> it is like the firſt, and therefore is already anſwered. Thus farre the reuerend Biſhop.</p>
               <p>If <hi>old learning</hi> can ſatisfie this <hi>illumination,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop muſt <hi>gang alone.</hi> If it cannot, <hi>old learning</hi> ſhall haue a writ of dotage. The Biſhop ſhall haue the Church of <hi>England</hi> that <hi>furious one,</hi> and all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to beare him company.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:21007:103"/>
               <p>The Homilie concludeth <hi>p.</hi> 132. That <hi>Images ought to be aboliſhed:</hi> ſo doth the Biſhop <hi>p.</hi> 383. But Maſter <hi>Mountagu</hi> will none of that, <hi>Appeale, p.</hi> 255. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which our Church and the Biſhop doth alleadge is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are <hi>the cauſe of much euill,</hi> M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſaith no; <hi>they are ſometimes profitable,</hi> Gagg. p. 318. But I will follow the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Biſhop: let him gang alone for me.</p>
               <p>By theſe arguments of our Church, propounded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and defended againſt his exceptions, it doth euidently appeare, that Images in Churches, and imployed (as he appointed) are vnlawfull; and from thence may neceſſarily be inferred againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and M. <hi>Mountagu;</hi> that,</p>
               <p>Honour is not due to Images.</p>
               <p>If hee doth not reſt content with this proofe, it ſtands him vpon to ſhew vs the diuine law, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth man, to giue honour to Images: foraſmuch as, without ſuch a law, the honouring of them, is an humane inuention, &amp; a ſeruice done vnto God, which he reiecteth as odious and abhominable: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the faith decreed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and receiued by M. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> touching the hauing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying, and honouring of Images, is erronious.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The former point of workes of ſupererogation, is diſputed.</head>
               <p>ACcording to our former courſe, three queſtions are to bee handled.</p>

                     <hi>2 Whether in affirming of them, hee conſent with

               <p>In this Chapter, I haue brought no Doctrine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I haue followed the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which hath decreed nothing in this point. Therefore the faith of that Church in this point, is to bee taken out of the Doctrine commonly receiued amongſt them touching it, and becauſe there is no Author amongſt them fitter to report what that is, then <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> I will ſet downe what he ſaith of it, it is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy men may doe ſuch things for Gods ſake, which they are not bound to doe; and theſe are workes of ſupererogation, de Indul. lib. 1. cap. 4. Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo non, &amp;c. de Monachis lib. 2. cap.</hi> 7. 9. 13.</p>
               <p>The G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gger hath the ſame thing reported by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> in his <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 104. in the margin, in theſe words,</p>
               <p>Man by aſsiſtance of Gods grace, may doe ſome things counſelled: and theſe we call worke of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That hee doth conſent vnto this Doctrine of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee profeſſeth plainely, and fully. Thus he writeth: <hi>I willingly ſubſcribe vnto the point of councels Euangelicall,</hi> Gagge, page 103. and further he ſaith, of the definition of workes of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I haue reported out of him, <hi>no</hi> 1. giuen by his aduerſary the Gagger. <hi>If theſe were your workes of ſupererogation and no otherwiſe, I would not contend with you,</hi> page 104.</p>
               <p>Hee doth agree with them likewiſe in explicating
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21007:104"/> and ſetting downe the nature of a <hi>Councell euangelicall,</hi> (as he cals it.) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith thus of it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a good worke ſhewed; not commanded: it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from a Precept in this, a Precept bindeth of its owne force, a Councell is committed to mans free choyce; when a precept is obſerued, it hath the reward; being not obſerued, it hath puniſhment: but if a Councell bee not obſerued, it hath no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; if it bee obſerued, it hath the greater reward, de Monachis, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Iuſt on this manner writeth he; <hi>Imperious lawes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire exact obedience vpon paine of puniſhment,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, page 219. <hi>A Councell is a mandat, not properly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with condition, left vnto a mans choyce to doe it, or not to doe it,</hi> page 221. laſtly, he ſaith, <hi>the obedience to Councels, procureth reward to him that obeyeth them,</hi> Gagge, page 105. <hi>and hee that keepeth them not, is without danger of puniſhment therefore,</hi> Gagge, page 103.</p>
               <p>A man would thinke by this, that hee would not ſticke to confeſſe that he agreeth with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the point of workes of ſupererogation: but indeed he doth deny it: for thus he writeth,</p>
               <p>You call workes of ſupererogation, ſuch as be laid vp in ſtore for imployments, the treaſure and ſtocke of the Church, to ſatisfie for other mens offences, not the things done as counſelled, onely: theſe are only titular, thoſe are indeed workes of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which you mean, but theſe I deny, <hi>Gagge, page 103. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; this excuſe is headleſſe, what hand ruled his pen when hee wrote thus, paſſeth my skill to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21007:105"/> iudge: he doth heare the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with one conſent to affirme, <hi>voluntary workes are workes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation:</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith the ſame expreſly, and in ſo many words: and yet (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) he will needs beare them both downe, they giue voluntary workes the name onely of workes of ſupererogation; but they meant it not. But I pray who told him ſo? he nameth no Author for it, nor can name, (I am ſure.) Well, he had it by ſpeciall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and therefore hee might know their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without them, and you muſt beleeue him, for ſuch knowledge is certaine, and cannot deceiue you. Be it ſo: he doth diſagree in the name: but that will not inferre his diſagreement in the thing. Hee hath confeſſed his ſubſcription to Euangelicall Councels, (that is) to voluntary workes, as I haue ſhewed in the former Chapter, and that is all which is ſought after: now we find his agreement with them in the thing: let him giue what name he will vnto voluntary workes.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an errour in Diuinitie, not to put a difference betwixt ſuch workes as a man may doe, or not doe without guilt of ſinne, or breach of law; and the Papiſts workes of ſupererogation. If any man not knowing, or not conſidering the ſtate of the queſtion, hath otherwiſe Written, or Preached, or Taught, it was his ignorance, or fancie, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding, or miſapplying;</hi> Appeale, page 215.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; in ſtead of proofes, wee haue euill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: I will ſcumme off the froth, and examine what hee ſaith in good ſober ſadneſſe. This is the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21007:105"/> ſumme of his ſentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that ſaith voluntary workes (in the iudgement of the Church of</hi> Rome) <hi>be workes of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ignorant or fantaſticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto which propoſition I may adde this aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Church of England</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cals voluntary workes, workes of ſupererogation,</hi> Artic. 14. So doth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I haue ſhewed out of <hi>Bellarmine, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ignorant and fantaſticall.</p>
               <p>2 O M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu,</hi> who doe you make your ſelfe to be? doe you know the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> better then your Mother? nay, better then your ſelfe? you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that Article, and thereby profeſſed thoſe words of her to bee true; is the other end of your tongue turned outwards, that you now vnſay what you ſaid then? did you then know, and now are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant? But ſuppoſe you might make thus bold with your Mother and your ſelfe; doe you thinke to beg all the learned in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for fooles, that vnderſtand not their owne faith? but you would bee thought farre from this: therefore your propoſition is falſe in the ſame thoughts.</p>
               <p>3 The propoſition doth ſuppoſe, that,</p>
               <p>Workes laid vp in ſtore, to ſatisfie for other mens offences, called the treaſure of the Church, are the Papiſts workes of ſupererogation.</p>
               <p>And ſo hee ſpeaketh expreſly, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 103. 105. 106. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this is a meere preſumption without truth;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21007:106"/> auouched barely vpon his owne word without ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring any proofe. You muſt proue what you ſay, or elſe you bring words of the wind.</p>
               <p>Againſt you I proue thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 That which is laid vp in ſtore to ſatisfie for others, is not workes, but the value and price of workes,</hi> viz. <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> Bellarm. de Indul. lib. 1. cap. 2. 1 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ. 4 Propoſ. cap. 3. 1 Propoſ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore that which is laid vp in ſtore to ſatisfie for others, cannot be their works of ſupererogation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs ſuppoſe that the <hi>voluntary workes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <hi>be ſo laid vp,</hi> yet can they not therefore be their <hi>works of ſupererogation,</hi> and thus I ſhew it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If voluntary workes, laid vp in the treaſury of the Church, be therefore their works of ſupererogation,</hi> then works done according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, are alſo their works of ſupererogation; for the ſatisfaction ariſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them is alſo laid vp in the treaſury of the Church, to ſatisfie for other, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth <hi>de Indulg. lib. 1. c. 4. Reſpondeo, non eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that works done according to the Morall Law are not their <hi>works of ſupererogation,</hi> I take as granted.</p>
               <p>Of his agreement, or diſagreement, with the church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of <hi>England</hi> in the point of voluntary works, you need not make a queſtion; for (if you will beleeue him) The Church of <hi>England</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hath no doctrine againſt Euangelicall counſels,</hi> Gag. page 103. For now voluntary works and euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call counſells are the ſame, as wee haue heard out of <hi>Bellarmine de Monachis. lib. 1. cap. 7. Quantum ad &amp;c.</hi> and as himſelfe doth expound it, out of <hi>Philaſtrius,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> Gag. p. 10. But this imputation is an

                  </gap>oule, that it deſerueth no other anſwer, but his owne words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bluſh for ſhame,</hi> Gagg. p. 250.</p>
               <p>For the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith expreſly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntarie workes, beſides, ouer and aboue Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, cannot be taught.</hi> Arti. 14. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man cannot, for Gods ſake, doe more then of bounden duty is required,</hi> which is as much as if it had ſaid, <hi>There be no voluntary workes at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be, he will ſay, yee doe him wrong, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſpeaketh not abſolutely: but <hi>ſo farre as he knoweth;</hi> I anſwer, Thoſe are his words indeed: but marke the ſenſe, thoſe words ſeeme to be rather a confirmation then a limitation of his deniall: for is it credible that he could not read this Article? Or that hee did not know, 1. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> had made this Article. 2. Or that the Church meant to deny thoſe workes indeed which it doth deny in words? Or that this Article is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Surely none of theſe may bee conceiued. Therefore we may conclude (as a thing very probable) that his intent was to auouch that denyall, vpon his owne knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now the Iudgement of our Church, and of Maſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                  <hi>Mountagu,</hi> in the point of voluntary workes, is fully known; &amp; that they are contradictory; it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he diſſenteth from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the point of voluntary workes. But before I paſſe from it, one thing is worthy obſervation. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> hath ſubſcribed contradictories. He ſubſcribed the Article that ſaith, <hi>there is no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21007:107"/> workes,</hi> and he ſubſcribed that <hi>there is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary works,</hi> Gagg. p. 103. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Can any man tell what this man would doe to bee <hi>Chiefe muftie?</hi> I doubt himſelf cannot. But pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: his ends were contrary; He muſt ſubſcribe the Article, or miſſe aduancement. He muſt ſubſcribe the other, or be no reconciler. He meant to attaine both; Hee hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt, &amp; he profeſſeth himſelf for the ſecond, <hi>Appeale pag.</hi> 292. He hath put hard for it in both his bookes: therefore it was reaſon he ſhould ſubſcribe on both ſides. In the firſt, he ſubſcribed to what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are, in the ſecond to what they ought to be.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now come to diſpute the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
               </p>
               <p>A man may doe voluntary workes.</p>
               <p>Wherein I might firſt proue the negatiue: but it ſeemeth better; to reſolue with M. <hi>Mountagu, Appeale, pag</hi> 218 That <hi>it would be loſt labour to ſeeeke, or goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to beetle it into his braines, becauſe he ſaith, Appeale pag. 218. All antiquity is of opinion, there are Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall counſels.</hi> And hee reſolueth <hi>Appeale, pag. 224. to ioyne in opinion with them.</hi> And he giues this reaſon for it, <hi>Appeale, p. 240. I am tyed not to preach or publiſh otherwiſe (according to the Cannons preſcribed vnto Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in ſuch caſes, Anno 1571.) Knowing it to be the reſolued doctrine of antiquitie as I doe. I am not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable if I tranſgreſſe the Cannons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding; becauſe hee may change his mind, therefore I will proceed and proue,</p>
               <p>There be no voluntary workes.</p>
               <p>My firſt argument ſhall be the words of the Article already alleadged <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whoſe authoritie onely
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21007:107"/> ought to be ſufficient to Mr. <hi>Mountagu;</hi> becauſe hee hath ſubſcribed thoſe words of the Article as true, and hath vowed <hi>to forſake all others, and follow his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 183. And the rather, becauſe thoſe words doe ſo plainely and fully deny voluntary workes.</p>
               <p>My ſecond argument ſhall bee the ſame which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> find in the Article on this ſort to be framed;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer teacheth voluntary workes, they be proud, arrogant, and impious.</hi> For ſaith the Article,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntary workes cannot be taught, without pride, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, and impietie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no man may be proud, arrogant, and impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore voluntary workes may not be taught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be obiected, that the firſt part of this reaſon is extended too far; becauſe it reacheth vnto antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And alſo it doth paſſe too hard a ſentence vpon ſuch as teach voluntarie workes.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, both parts of this obiection be falſe: and the reſpect we owe, vnto the firſt compoſers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmers of that Article, doth bind vs to thinke ſo: for they were able <hi>to drop Fathers</hi> with M. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> and gouerne their paſſions, better then hee can gouerne his.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the thing it ſelfe doth ſay no leſſe. Neuer any Father taught the popiſh <hi>voluntary workes.</hi> If M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> will ſay the contrary. He muſt ſhew thoſe fathers, that teach of voluntary workes, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, <hi>de Monachis. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 7. and 8. which he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to doe. Againſt the ſecond part of the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Article diſputeth thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that teach, that, men render vnto God, ſo much
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21007:108"/> as they are bound, and more alſo, they are arrogant and impious:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They take vpon them more then is true, againſt the word of God, which ſaith, when you haue done all that are commanded to you, ſay, wee be vnprofitable ſeruants,</hi> Luke 17. 10.</p>
               <p>But they that teach voluntary workes, teach that men doe render vnto God, ſo much as they are bound, and more alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo doth Bellarmine expreſly teach, de Monachis lib. 2. cap. 6, Secundo Comparando, and cap.</hi> 12. at the very end thereof, and in many other places.</p>
               <p>Therefore they that teach voluntary workes, are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant and impious.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> can ſatisfie the premiſſes of this argument, he may auoid the concluſion: but I deſpaire of that: for hee muſt ioyne with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the aſſumption, becauſe he that keepes not the law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe voluntary workes, which is more then a man is bound too: ſeeing thoſe proceed from <hi>a common, inioyned, and limited perfection of loue:</hi> As we learne from <hi>Bellarmine, de Monachis lib. 2. cap. 6. Tertio Comparando:</hi> and Mr <hi>Mountagu</hi> himſelfe teacheth no leſſe, when he ſaith, <hi>obedience to Councels proceeds from grace,</hi> therefore of loue. He ſaith, <hi>they are left to a mans choyce,</hi> therefore his loue is voluntary, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited. He ſaith alſo, <hi>theſe works are worthy of more praiſe:</hi> therefore they proceed out of a higher degree and perfection of loue, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 103. And that the doer of theſe workes, doth keepe the law, the thing it ſelfe doth teſtifie: for he that is able to doe workes of greater perfection, muſt needs be able to doe workes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21007:108"/> of leſſe: ſeeing the leſſe is comprehended in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: beſides, hee that commeth ſhort of keeping the Law, how can hee goe beyond the Law, in louing God, by doing workes left vnto his choyce? If any man will ſay, he may doe theſe voluntary workes, and yet come ſhort of doing the workes of the Law, as Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> doth, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 104. hee muſt ſhew me the man that did ſo, and the actions wherein they did ſo, and proue it ſufficiently, elſe I muſt beleeue our Church, <hi>Artic.</hi> 14. and the things themſelues that ſay the contrary.</p>
               <p>He cannot auoyd the propoſition: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> cannot, though he hath done his beſt for that purpoſe, <hi>de Monachis lib. 2. cap. 13. Reſpondeo Petrum, &amp;c.</hi> as he that readeth it may ſee: and I will ſhew. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> anſwereth to this argument, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord doth not ſay,</hi> Luke 17. and 10. <hi>you are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. But willeth them to ſay, wee are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruants.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is his will that we ſhould be humble, and not boaſt of our merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Himſelfe ſaith afterwards, Thou good ſeruant and faithfull. But he cals him onely, vnprofitable, that diſobeyeth the Law, and is caſt into vtter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Mat. 25. 26. &amp; 30. verſes.</p>
               <p>I reply; this anſwer, (as it lyeth) is nothing to the purpoſe, it doth not gaineſay any part of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet I will bring the particulars, and ſee how they may be applied to the purpoſe, He ſaith,</p>
               <p>Our Lord bid them ſay they were vnprofitable: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did not ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>I grant this; neither does the argument ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21007:109"/> It may be he would inferre from hence;</p>
               <p>Therefore they ſay, they are vnprofitable ſeruants; but are not.</p>
               <p>If this concluſion were true, the anſwer would bee ſufficient, and the argument of no force: but this part of his anſwer cannot inferre this concluſion: for then, our Lord ſhould teach him to lye, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dareth not affirme: yea from thence it may bee truely inferred, that they were indeed vnprofitable ſeruants: but Chriſt is the teacher of truth, and in bidding them <hi>ſay they were vnprofitable,</hi> it is as much as if hee had ſaid himſelfe, they were indeed vnprofitable: for hee would not put any ſentence into mans mouth, which himſelfe would not affirme: theſe things I take as granted, and offer no proofe for them. He ſaith;</p>
               <p>2 It is his will we ſhould be humble, and not boaſters.</p>
               <p>I grant this alſo, neither doth the argument ſay the contrary. It may be he brings this to proue, That,</p>
               <p>The foreſaid confeſsion was not according to truth.</p>
               <p>But it doth not proue it: for humility and falſe ſpeaking doe not goe together. It doth rather inferre the contrary; he would haue vs humble, therefore he would haue vs ſpeake the truth; for both of them are vertues proceeding from the ſpirit of truth; and there is no greater ſigne of humility, then when men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their failings truely: He ſaith further;</p>
               <p>3 They that ſo confeſſe, are called good ſeruants and faithfull.</p>
               <p>Let this be granted alſo, and it will agree well with euery part of the argument. I ſuppoſe his intent is to ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they that did thus confeſſe, were indeed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21007:109"/> profitable ſeruants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this doth not follow from that; for our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might call them good, though they failed in ſome things, wherein they were vnprofitable ſeruants; and yet ſpeake according to truth: for his ſeruants are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, to all purpoſes of loue, no leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, then if they were abſolutely good and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in nothing. Againe, he blotteth out their failings, (whereby they are vnprofitable) out of his Booke, whereof it is, that they are not imputed vnto them, and they ſtand before God, as if they had neuer failed: Laſtly, ſuch doe inioy the habit of grace, and bring forth the fruits thereof: by which they are truely good, and from whence they may truely haue the name of good, and faithfull ſeruants.</p>
               <p>He ſaith fourthly,</p>
               <p>They onely that diſobey the Law, and are caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, are called vnprofitable ſeruants.</p>
               <p>This ſentence, hath not to doe with the argument any more then the former; and it is falſe in it ſelfe. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo that doe not ſo diſobey the law, as that they are therefore caſt into hell, may bee called vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,</hi> which I proue by this argument,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Saints are truely called vnprofitable ſeruants, becauſe euery breaker of the Law, may truely be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an vnprofitable ſeruant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Saints doe ſo breake the Law, that they are not therefore caſt into condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore ſome <hi>that doe ſo breake the Law, that they are not therefore caſt into condemnation, are called vnprofitable ſeruants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Saints doe <hi>breake the Law, is cleare,</hi> by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21007:110"/> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8. 10. and that therefore they are not caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to condemnation, it is as certaine by <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. But theſe two, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſanctified and vnſanctified, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>vnprofitable ſeruants</hi> in a different ſenſe. They that goe to hell, haue that name <hi>totally, vniuerſally, and finally;</hi> they neuer haue the name of good ſeruants: for they are totally and finally vnprofitable ſeruants, as the place now alleadged, <hi>Mat. 25. 26. &amp; 30. verſes</hi> ſheweth, which ſaith, that the vnprofitable ſeruant gained nothing by his talent; and that by his owne choyce and reſolution. The other that goe not to hell, hath both: they are <hi>vnprofitable</hi> for a time: they are profitable finally, or for euer. They are called <hi>vnprofitable</hi> in ſome reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> In reſpect of their faylings, and as they are in themſelues; but they are called <hi>good and faithfull, totally, finally, and vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> by meanes of their grace, of the not-imputing of their faylings, and of Gods fauour, wherein they are made good, by the receiuing of all ſupernaturall good things.</p>
               <p>By this, (I hope) it doth appeare, the argument which our Church vſeth againſt voluntary workes, is ſtrong and ſufficient againſt the pretences of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to defend this Doctrine of the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of <hi>England,</hi> by anſwering ſuch arguments as I finde brought by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> againſt it. <hi>Bellarmine de Monachis, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8. at the end ſaith; <hi>Euangelicall Councels be chiefly of continency, obedience, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> in his <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 103. doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance them in <hi>virginity and wilfull pouerty; Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> alleadgeth <hi>Mat. 29. and 21. 1 Cor. 7. 25. and</hi> 28.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21007:110"/> to proue that theſe be Euangelicall Councels, <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachis lib. 2. cap. 9. arg. 5. and</hi> 7. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the ſame places, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 105. and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that they ſpeake of Euangelicall Councels; by which he diſputeth in this ſort;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilfull pouerty,</hi> Mar. 19. and 21. <hi>ſingle life,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 25. and 28. <hi>may bee done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilfull pouerty,</hi> Mat. 19. and 21. <hi>ſingle life,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 25. and 28. <hi>be voluntary workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ſome voluntary workes may be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; the firſt part of this argument is falſe; the places alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dged doe not ſhew, or commend wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pouerty, and virginity vnto all men. Thoſe places belong onely to particular perſons and times. In <hi>Matth.</hi> our Sauiour ſpeaketh vnto the yong man, that would know what hee ſhould doe to come to heauen: The Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> directeth his anſwer to ſuch as doubted, what to doe in caſe of mariage; and we doe not finde in the word of God, that theſe anſwers are extended any further, and many things in the places themſelues doe reſtrain them onely to thoſe perſons and times.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Argument is alſo falſe. A voluntary worke; firſt, <hi>is good;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>more then the Law requires;</hi> thirdly, <hi>gratefull or acceptable to God;</hi> fourthly, <hi>a meanes leading to eternall life;</hi> fiftly, <hi>left vnto a mans choyce, not ſtrictly commanded to bee done or not done;</hi> as wee learne by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place alleadged, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu, Gagge, page</hi> 104. 105. and 106. But this <hi>ſelling, Mat.</hi> 19. and <hi>abſtaining, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. haue not theſe properties. Therefore they are not voluntary workes. That they are not meanes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21007:111"/> leading vnto heauen, will eaſilie bee granted, by euery man, that hath any experience in the word of God, or the worke of grace: for there is no promiſe of heauen made to a man, vpon condition of hispouerty, or virginity, rather then to him that is rich and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If any man thinkes otherwiſe, let him ſhew that promiſe in ſome other place of Scripture; I ſay in ſome other place of Scripture, becauſe it is vſuall with the holy Ghoſt, to repeat, illuſtrate, &amp; vrge the means of ſaluation, and the connexion of heauen thereunto, in more places then one. If that cannot be found (as without doubt it cannot) then it muſt be ſhewed, that, theſe places alleadged doe containe it expreſly, and without doubtfulneſſe: for the holy Ghoſt would not content himſelfe to ſhew vs a meanes of ſaluation, by obſcure and doubtfull termes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>wilfull pouerty, and virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> in the places alleadged <hi>be meanes of euerlaſting life,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> ioynes with him in it. <hi>Gagg. p. 105. and 106. Bellarmine</hi> proues the firſt is <hi>to be a meanes of life,</hi> becauſe our Sauiour ſaith to the yong man, <hi>thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen.</hi> And M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it with the ſame words. <hi>Gagg. p.</hi> 105. I anſwer vnto them both, our Sauiour made not this promiſe, vnto his <hi>ſelling;</hi> but to his <hi>comming vnto, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt.</hi> I proue it, becauſe, this promiſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed immediately vnto his comming, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming importeth a <hi>deniall of himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>taking vp his croſſe:</hi> which is, <hi>an obedience due vnto God neceſſarily,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth in that 9. chapter alleadged, <hi>Septimum &amp;c. reſpondeo haec, &amp;c.</hi> and alſo becauſe that denyal, &amp;c. is aſſigned as a means of ſaluation, &amp; vrged
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21007:111"/> as a neceſſary duty in many places of Scripture. But the Scripture hath not any ſuch word of <hi>wilfull pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Againe, when the Diſciples in the chapter alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; verſe 27. pleaded that <hi>they had forſaken all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, &amp; demanded what they ſhould haue,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them euerlaſting life; and aſſigneth only their <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of him,</hi> as the meanes thereof, but hath not a word of their <hi>leauing of all,</hi> ver. 28. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth proofe in that 9. chapter, alleadged, <hi>I am vero, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>virginity is a meanes of ſalvation:</hi> and that both the places of Scripture alleadged in the argument, doe ſpeake vnto all the faithfull. <hi>At contra, &amp;c.</hi> But I paſſe them ouer with ſilence, becauſe M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> hath not a word of them, and the proofes themſelues are ſo ſlight &amp; childiſh, that to ſet them in forme, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, would be loſſe of my labor, &amp; a burthen to the reader. Thus I conclude my anſwer to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: becauſe M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> hath brought nothing in confirmation thereof more, then I haue ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath other arguments to proue <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 
                  <hi>workes;</hi> but they are not worthy anſwer: becauſe M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> doth omit them, and theſe two places of Scripture, are the chiefe and principall.</p>
               <p>And with this I might end this whole point, but, that, he is importunate, <hi>Appeale, p.</hi> 22 1. with one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he is ſure to make you confeſſe, that, a man may doe voluntary workes, theſe are his words,</p>
               <p>If you will needs deny Euangelicall councels, you will be foundworſe by farre then Papiſts.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Shew vs wherein we ſhould be <hi>worſe then Papiſts,</hi> &amp; then you ſay ſome thing that may perhaps bring vs to your bow. If that wil ſerue turn, he wil not

               <p>You are conuicted in your conſciences willingly to breake thoſe words of our Sauiour; Goe ſell all that thou haſt and giue it to the poore, which you are perſwaded is a precept.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; I let paſſe by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quarrells, and come to the matter. By <hi>precept</hi> you meane a precept to vs, elſe you cannot charge vs to breake it, that doe not ſo ſell. That being obſerued, you charge vs falſely. Shew vs the man that hath ſaid, that thoſe words of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are a commandement vnto vs. <hi>Bellarmine de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachis. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 9. will ſhew you two men, that denies it, <hi>viz. Caluin</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> hee bringeth them both ſaying, <hi>theſe words were ſpoken onely to the young man.</hi> And he that readeth his Confirmation of his 5 argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall find it ſo.

               <p>Yet ſo ioyous, confident, and iocund is hee in this argument, as if all were his owne, as if hee had ſpoken nothing but what was as true as Goſpell; therefore he proceedeth on this wiſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you doe not ſell all that you haue and giue it to the</hi>

               <p>If you demand of him wherein that diſſimulation ſhould lye, he is not to ſeeke for anſwer; thus he doth ſhew it you;</p>
               <p>You would perſwade men of a caſe of neceſsity, that your ſelues may feed fat vpon their folly.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, when I read this paſſage, I could not but ſtand amazed, and my heart within mee became cold,

               </list>
               <p>We omit to enquire, whether he conſenteth with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or not: becauſe the Counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed nothing (that I can finde) tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the nature of Predeſtination; and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of their Schooles diſſenteth not from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Some doe diſſent, as <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi> and others with him in former times. And in latter times <hi>Gabriel Vaſquez,</hi> and ſome others with him; but the difference, is rather in Poſition, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking; then really, and in the thing.</p>
               <p>The diſputation in this Chapter is reſtrained vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſecond onely: for of this point, he ſaith, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 61.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:21007:114"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it as I conceiue it, and ſo ſhall profeſſe it, vntill I am informed and aſcertained, that the Church of</hi> England <hi>teacheth all otherwiſe then I conceiue of it.</hi>

                  <hi>He drew them out which tooke hold of mercy.</hi>

                  </gap>ſtination, for it concerneth mans ordering vnto his laſt end, and perfection. The other ſixe, belong not thereto; for they ſpeake of mans being, and the cauſes thereof, and things pertaining thereto. They haue not a word of ordering man, to any end. If this ſeuenth branch bee framed according to Art, it will ſtand thus;</p>
               <p>Predeſtination to life, is an act or decree of Gods will, whereby he purpoſed to draw them out of the ſtate of perdition, which tooke hold of mercy.</p>
               <p>In this frame, wee haue the thing defined, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whereby it is defined; I reſtraine the queſtion vnto Predeſtination to life, becauſe our Church doth ſo:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21007:114"/> Artic. 17. and the Scriptures are more frequent in that; and no meruaile why, becauſe the Scriptures were written for the direction, and conſolation of them that ſhall goe to heauen, I haue framed it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by his owne direction: the queſtion of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is put ſo by himſelfe, as I will now ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 38. hee calleth it <hi>an act or decree of God,</hi> which muſt needes be an act of his <hi>will:</hi> and ſo hee termeth it, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 61. This act is immanent, not tranſient; for he ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues it, ſetting by, all execution of purpoſe:</hi> and againe he ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>he that is actually Saued, is ſo ſaued, according to the purpoſe of his decree. So ſaued, are So ordained by God,</hi> Gagge, page 177. He ſaith further, <hi>Gods will is the cauſe of things, either poſitiuely by diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, or by permiſsion, &amp;c,</hi> Gagge, page 177. Hee doth take this <hi>act of Gods will,</hi> to bee a <hi>poſitiue,</hi> not a permiſſiue <hi>diſpoſing:</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>whatſoeuer was done in time, was So diſpoſed of, and ordered before all time,</hi> Gagge, page 178.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Them,</hi> imports, that man is the ſubiect of Predeſtination; a certaine number of men, not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all; and ſo he ſpeaketh, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>The words <hi>out of,</hi> &amp;c. imply, that the predeſtinate to life, (in our apprehenſion, or (as they ſay) in <hi>ſigno rationis,</hi>) were in the ſtate of perdition, before they were predeſtinate: and ſo the ſteps which in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, are obſerued by God, toward the Predeſtinate, and related in the former Chapter, doe expreſly ſhew; which alſo he hath, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 52. fully and plainely.</p>
               <p>Theſe words <hi>which tooke hold of mercy,</hi> doe ſignifie,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21007:115"/> that in Gods foreknowledge, the Predeſtinate doe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally beleeue and repent, &amp;c. before they are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, or before the will of Predeſtination is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them: and that this faith &amp; repentance, &amp;c. is the obiectiue reaſon, mouing, and regulating the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will of Predeſtination, vnto the party predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; ſo as if you aske the reaſon why God did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate ſome, it is anſwered, becauſe he would. If you demand further why he did predeſtinate this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man; it is anſwered, becauſe hee tooke hold of Gods mercy in the meanes of ſaluation offered, by beleeuing and repenting; and this I take from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: where he ſaith, <hi>He that is actually ſaued, is So ſaued, according to the purpoſe of Gods decree conſequent, not antecedent,</hi> Gagge, p. 177. And again, he ſaith; <hi>men are not ſaued without relation to their repentance,</hi> Appeale, page 74. which thing is moſt fully declared, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 58. where he blameth this ſentence: <hi>Gods decree to glorifie</hi> Peter, <hi>was without any conſideration had of, or regard vnto his faith, obedience, repentance:</hi> which ſentence for ſubſtance he ſetteth down, and reiecteth, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 179. And <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 74. he ſaith, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finall perſeuering, they are none of Gods elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>he drew them out, &amp;c.</hi> hee placeth <hi>the whole terme or end of predeſtination in giuing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> This thing he implyeth alſo, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 78. where he ſaith, <hi>It is your owne, God appointed to giue grace and glory;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>this ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to you; I diſclaime it.</hi> If man hath grace before he be predeſtinate, then grace is not the <hi>terme or end</hi> of Predeſtination: he affirmes the firſt, ſo muſt he doe the laſt.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:21007:115"/>
               <p>Thus we haue his ſentence of Predeſtination, and the ſenſe thereof: now wee muſt compare the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with it; that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may ſee, whether our Church hath oppoſed the contrary thereto or not, which hee affirmeth it doth, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 179.</p>

               <p>And thus ſtandeth the Doctrine of the 17. Article, each part being placed according to art: the ſenſe whereof I will now alſo declare.</p>
               <p>PREDESTINATION, is the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> whoſe nature our Church doth declare, by that which followeth.</p>
               <p>IS, hath the place of a band, to tye the following part of the ſentence, vnto that which went before.</p>
               <p>GODS DECREE; Theſe words ſignifie that thing which Predeſtination hath in common with oher actions of Gods will, called the generall nature: it doth expreſſe alſo, the principall efficient; namely, GOD, and an act of his will.</p>
               <p>ETERNALL; This doth ſet out, what kinde
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21007:116"/> of act Predeſtination is, (to wit) ſuch an act as is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vnto God: yea, it is <hi>of</hi> his eſſence, for nothing is eternall, but the being of God. This act of his will doth remaine in God, &amp; is vſually called an immanent act, for it paſſeth not out of God, working a reall change in the creature, which is the property of a tranſient act.</p>
               <p>We conceiue that this act of Predeſtination, is an <hi>eliciated act</hi> of Gods will; and an eliciated act is that which floweth from a power, that is the beginning thereof; as beleeuing is an act which proceedeth from the faculty which the ſoule hath to beleeue. But Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is an eliciated act (in our apprehenſion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:) by reaſon we are not able to apprehend the being of God as it is. Whereas the eſſence of God is a pure act, altogether without mixture of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act, conſidered apart, and ſeparated in the thing. Laſtly, the relation that this act hath, vnto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is rationall, not reall: God is a being of himſelfe, without reſpect vnto any created effect.</p>
               <p>CONSTANT, This importeth the certaine euent and infallible performance of the thing decreed by Predeſtination; ſo as he to whom God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace and glory, ſhall not faile of either of them, but inioy them both without miſſing: And that this is the true intent of our Church, it is very plaine: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not call the decree it ſelfe, or God in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing, <hi>Conſtant.</hi> For that it hath already declared in the word <hi>Eternall,</hi> which ſignifies a duration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or ending; which doth ſo fully and plainely expreſſe, the conſtancy of God in decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the word <hi>Conſtant</hi> cannot adde any thing thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:21007:116"/>
               <p>BY HIS COVNSELL. By theſe words, our Church ſheweth; 1. that Gods vnderſtanding is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his will, in this act of Predeſtination; for counſell is an act proper to the vnderſtanding: 2. This act of the vnderſtanding (to ſpeake according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacitie) is to iudge the act of Predeſtination to be good, and to perſwade thereunto, by the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reaſon: for ſo we conceiue the vnderſtanding to direct the will; and, this is the nature, or condition of Councell; he that counſelleth doth thus.</p>
               <p>SECRET TO VS, By <hi>ſecret</hi> is meant vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed; the iudgement then of our Church, ſet down in this ſentence, may be expreſſed in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſon, that moued God to predeſtinate this, or that perſon, is vnknowne to vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO BRING TO SALVATION; Theſe words, doe ſet forth the ſpeciall, and proper nature, and formall being of Predeſtination: by which it is diſtinguiſhed from all other actions of God; and they import the terme or end of Predeſtination, or the thing appointed to bee giuen by this decree of God; which conſiſteth in <hi>happineſſe</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> after this life; ſignified by the word <hi>ſaluation:</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> in this life, by the words, <hi>bring vnto, by Chriſt.</hi> For God doth not bring man to ſaluation, but by means, and that means can be nothing but grace: for can it bee conceiued, how our comming to ſaluation can bee attributed to God as his worke, but by reaſon that hee doth giue grace?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it cannot bee conceiued, how God ſhould bring to ſaluation <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> but, by giuing of grace: ſeeing none come to ſaluation by Chriſt, but ſuch, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21007:117"/> are members of Chriſt; and none are members of Chriſt, but by the meanes of grace.</p>
               <p>And that it was the meaning of our Church, to make finall grace one thing appointed by Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be giuen vnto man; it is apparent by that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Article which followeth; where it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Predeſtination to be the cauſe, or reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God beſtoweth grace, and glory vpon man in the euent, for thus it ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore they which bee indued with this excellent benefit,</hi> viz. <hi>of Predeſtination, be called, according to Gods purpoſe, by his Spirit, they through grace, obey the calling, and at length by Gods mercy, they attaine to ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY CHRIST; Hereby our Church, doth ſet forth the means (appointed by Predeſtination,) wherby in courſe of time man ſhal enioy the thing appointed by Predeſtination, and that is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> vnder whoſe name, all other ſubordinate meanes are fitly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: and that our Church meant ſo, need not be doubted; becauſe it addeth other meanes of grace, and ſaluation, (beſides Chriſt,) in the doctrine of the Article following.</p>
               <p>TO DELIVER FROM DAMNATIOM. By this the nature of Predeſtination formerly deliuered, is ſet out or made more plaine vnto vs; for this being contrary vnto that, doth make it the more manifeſt vnto our vnderſtandings; and the Scripture taketh the ſame courſe alſo, as in many other places, ſo in theſe: <hi>He that beleeueth is paſſed from death vnto life: There is no condemnation to him that is in Chriſt: Rom.</hi> 8. 1. By <hi>damnation</hi> is not meant the ſtate of damnation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21007:117"/> for that ſenſe cannot ſtand with the doctrine of our Church which followeth; but by damnation is vnderſtood the poſſibilitie of being in the ſtate of damnation, preuented by the decree of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that ſenſe doth agree very well with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Article: which ſaith, <hi>This decree is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;</hi> as is declared before.</p>
               <p>SOME ELECTED OVT OF MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINDE. The ſubiect, or parties predeſtinated, are here ſayd to bee man, but not all men vniuerſally; it reſtraineth the ſame vnto ſome of mankinde, by ſaying that they are <hi>elected ones: and elected out of mankind.</hi> 2. The ſubiect that receiueth Predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is deſcribed by two things. The one by the name, and vnder the title of man meerly, without any addition; whereby is ſignified that man conceiued in himſelfe onely, as an intellectuall creature without grace or works of grace, is obiected vnto, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diuine will of Predeſtination, and in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely he receiueth the ſame. Our Church doth not ſay, that God waited till man had grace, and then, and vpon the intuition thereof, he was moued to, and did predeſtinate him. That this may be the ſenſe of our Church is cleere: becauſe it is a courſe agreeable and decent vnto the diuine prouidence, and man himſelfe: and that this muſt be meant by our Church, is certaine alſo, for no other ſenſe can be made therof agreeable to theſe words, and thoſe words that went before, which ſay, <hi>the reaſon mouing God to predeſtinate, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to vs:</hi> And grace is beſtowed by predeſtination. The other thing deſcribing it, is the word <hi>elect,</hi> which ſignifieth an act of Gods will, whereby our Church
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21007:118"/> doth giue vs to vnderſtand, that the reaſon why this or that man is predeſtinate, ariſeth from Gods will and pleaſure, of which it is, that the predeſtinate are ſingled out, and ſeuered from the reſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>IN CHRIST. Our Church referreth theſe words vnto the word elect, thus;</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom hee elected in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this ſentence, the word <hi>elect,</hi> doth ſignifie, 1. an act of Gods will. 2 An act going before predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3 A collection of a certaine number of men, (from others) to be predeſtinated, vnto this, or that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, and glory; for ſo it ſpeaketh in the 17. <hi>arti.</hi> ſaying,</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom he choſe, he decreed to bring to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The words <hi>in Chriſt</hi> tell vs, that Gods eye was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the choſen ones in or through Chriſt. Now this act of election, may bee done vpon man in the intuition of Chriſt, either as the end intended and aimed at in the act of election; or as the meritorious cauſe thereof. In the firſt ſenſe wee may not take our Church, ſeeing it ſaith, <hi>the reaſon that moued God to predeſtinate is ſecret to vs:</hi> wee muſt therefore vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Church to ſpeake in the firſt ſenſe; for that is moſt agreeable to the courſe of Scripture, to the dignity of Chriſt, and to the operation of grace in man. What heart is it that will not rather make it ſelfe ſubordinate vnto Chriſt, then Chriſt ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vnto him: And that our Church meant thus, we haue yet better reaſon to thinke, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe this whole deſcription of predeſtination is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the firſt chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaid in the fourth verſe, <hi>He hath choſen vs in him;</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:21007:118"/> He concludeth in the 12 verſe, <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory:</hi> which ſheweth that Chriſts glory was the end intended &amp; aimed at, in the act of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>BEFORE THE FOVNDATIONS OF THE WORLD WERE LAYD. (That is,) before the Creation. The world is created, either in the reall being thereof, or in the decree to create. Our Church ſpeaketh not of reall creating; for, then it ſhould ſay the decree of Predeſtination is before actuall Creation. This it could not meane, or that is as much as if it had ſaid, the decree of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is eternall: for before that creation, there is no duration but eternitie: But our Church meant not by theſe words to ſay, <hi>Gods decree was eternall:</hi> for it had ſaid ſo, in expreſſe words a little before, and this phraſe of ſpeech doth not make that more plaine: but, doth rather more obſcure it. Our Church then ſpeaketh of Gods decree to create, and ſo it ſetteth forth the moment wherein (in our apprehenſion) man is predeſtinate by God, and is, as if it had ſaid,</p>
               <p>Gods decree of Predeſtination (in our apprehenſion) goes before his decree of creation.</p>
               <p>And the rather all men ſhould vnderſtand our Church thus: becauſe this order is agreeable to the nature of the things themſelues: Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being more worthy of loue then Creation: That being ſupernatural, perpetuall, and mans laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; This being naturall, temporary, and at moſt but a way vnto that: therefore it is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, to conceiue the decree of Creation, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate vnto the decree of Predeſtination, then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination vnto Creation.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21007:119"/>
               <p>If any thinke that man cannot be predeſtinate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be actually made: I anſwer; in Gods will of execution it is true, man cannot inioy the being of the thing appointed by Predeſtination before hee hath actuall being himſelfe: now, the will of execution is not now in queſtion, but the will of intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely: man may be predeſtinated in the will of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, before he hath an actuall being; for God may ſo decree, when man is but in poſſibility to be: as <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> well obſerueth:</p>
               <p>AS VESSELS MADE TO HONOR; In this laſt branch our Church aſſigneth the end of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; the manner how it floweth from the ſame. The end is ſignified by theſe words, <hi>made vnto honour;</hi> by honor is ſignified, both the glory &amp; honor giuen vnto God, by declaring his attributes; as prouidence, and loue vnto the reaſonable creature; as alſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which the creature receiueth from God, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him face to face, wherein the true and proper nature of bleſſedneſſe conſiſteth. That being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, this the next end of Predeſtination: And that our Church doth meane thus, there is no cauſe of doubt, becauſe it agrees well with the preſent words, and the thing it ſelfe. It openeth the manner how the one floweth from the other, by ſaying, <hi>as veſſels made to honour;</hi> wherein the Predeſtinate are likened vnto veſſels, that receiue honour vnto themſelues, and are inſtruments in honourable offices vnto God. In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>as veſſels,</hi> our Church ſheweth, that this end iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the act of Predeſtination, immediately, and of the thing it ſelfe. There is nothing in man, added vnto the diuine will of Predeſtination, to make it fit
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21007:119"/> and apt for theſe effects: for ſuch is the condition of a veſſell, it cannot ſay to the Potter, thou hadſt ſufficient reaſon out of my ſelfe, why thou ſhouldeſt make mee a veſſel vnto honor, neither can it challenge the Potter for iniury vnto it, if he doth make it a veſſell not vnto honour. Laſtly, our Church ſaith, the Predeſtinate <hi>are made vnto honour,</hi> (to wit) by Predeſtination: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by efficiency of euery kinde is attributed vnto Gods will: no part of this honour is yeelded vnto the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate himſelfe: for then it muſt haue diuided the act of <hi>making to honour,</hi> betweene God and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate: but this it doth not, but giueth that act, onely to Gods will of Predeſtination.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I gone ouer the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereby it doth appeare, that our Church oppoſeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo fully, as nothing more can be required.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That which is oppoſed by many of the learned, and moſt conformable in the Church of</hi> England; <hi>that is oppoſed by the Church of</hi> England. But this ſentence, <hi>Predeſtination is without relation to faith, &amp;c.</hi> is oppoſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore this ſentence, &amp;c. is oppoſed by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; I will ſpeake to the point in queſtion, and let the reſt paſſe.</p>
               <p>The propoſition, or firſt ſentence of this reaſon, is falſe, by his owne rule, <hi>Appeale, page 48. and</hi> 49. where he ſaith;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The preſumptions of ſeruants, are not the Lords di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, euery one that Prateth, Readeth, Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Preacheth, or Profeſſeth, muſt not looke to haue his diſcourſes taken as the dictates, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Church:</hi> yes (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> page 59.) <hi>If they be of the learned and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in our Church; nay</hi> (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu,</hi> pag. 49. <hi>Our Mother hath ſufficiently made knowne her minde in Bookes that are publike, promulgated, authoriſed, and ſubſcribed, theſe are thoſe paſſages, at which the liſping</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites <hi>are to be tryed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some that be learned in our Church, doth oppoſe that ſentence, and ſo farre I grant the aſſumption: but their number exceeds not. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth otherwiſe, hee is one of the <hi>Duke of Burgundies ſpies, that taketh a field of Thiſtles, for an army of Pikes,</hi> page 320 and ſo the aſſumption is falſe, that ſpeaketh of many. Thoſe <hi>ſome</hi> doe oppoſe indeed: but priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21007:120"/> and in a corner. Let him ſhew, where euer that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was oppoſed in Print, or in publike place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controle: therefore their oppoſing is not our Churches oppoſing.</p>
               <p>His next reaſon is thus, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 59. &amp; 73. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
               </p>
               <p>If our Church it ſelfe doth teach, that a man may fall away from God, and become not the childe of God, then it oppoſeth that Doctrine of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But our Church doth ſo teach, directly, and in expreſſe words.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; He makes this matter like a <hi>Pedlers Horſe,</hi> that is acquainted with euery doore, a Knight of the Poſt, to depoſe in euery cauſe: In this cauſe his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is falſe, his Pedlers ware will not ſell.

               <p>
                  <hi>Our Church hath left it vndecided, and at liberty,</hi> p. 158. <hi>and</hi> 171. and I haue proued our Church doth not teach it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>It is bold importunity, to vrge that for true, which himſelfe denieth to be true, but better that then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It may perhaps be beleeued by ſome, where ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is a ſentence of guiltineſſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Our Church hath gone on in theſe high points, in great wiſedome, not concluding vpon Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; I grant thus much: Let him goe on in the words of our Church, and ſticke to them, and it ſufficeth: but what he would inferre from hence, I know not, I am ſure he may inferre, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore himſelfe in diſſenting from our Church,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21007:121"/> hath not done wiſely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third argument I finde, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 72. which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> is to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which was ſtiled againſt the Articles of</hi> Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, <hi>a deſperate Doctrine, at the Conference at</hi> Hampton <hi>Court, before his Maieſty without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, or taxation of any, is not the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Doctrine of</hi> Predeſtination, <hi>was ſo ſtiled,</hi> viz. <hi>by Doctor</hi> Bancroft, <hi>&amp;c. without reproofe of any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; the propoſition is as probably falſe, as true, ſuch a fault might be let paſſe for diuers reaſons of ſtate, and obſeruance. The aſſumption is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vntruth. The Booke that reporteth that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will ſhew it: for it reporteth that ſpeech of Biſhop <hi>Baneroft,</hi> page 29. in theſe words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many in theſe dayes, neglecting holineſſe of life, preſuming too much of perſiſting of grace; laying all their religion vpon</hi> Predeſtination. <hi>If I ſhall be ſaued, I ſhall be ſaued; which he termed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is not a word of Mr. <hi>Mountagues</hi> tale.</p>
               <p>According to him, the Doctor ſaith thus, this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</p>
               <p>Predeſtination <hi>is without relation to mans faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is a deſperate Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the Booke, the Doctor ſaith, this ſentence,</p>
               <p>The Predeſtinate may neglect holineſſe of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he ſhall be ſaued, he ſhall be ſaued,</p>
               <p>Is a deſperate Doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:21007:121"/>
               <p>Theſe two ſentences, are not ſo like, as the <hi>Hares head, and the Gooſe giblets,</hi> the one reproues the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſigned to Predeſtination, and telleth them, that Predeſtination is not ſuch as they ſay it is. The other reproueth men that abuſe the Doctrine of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but medleth not with the nature thereof, what difference then there is betweene the nature of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, and mans abuſe of Predeſtination, in the courſe of his life: ſuch difference there is, betweene M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mountagu</hi> and the Booke; he ſpeakes of the firſt, that of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But now let vs ſuppoſe the Doctor had ſaid theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> words.</p>
               <p>Predeſtination, <hi>without relation to faith, is a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the ſecond branch of his Aſſumption is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe falſe, becauſe it ſaith, <hi>that ſpeech was not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi> but I finde otherwiſe in the Booke, which repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>page</hi> 43. a ſpeech of his Maieſtie, that maketh Predeſtination, to be without relation to faith, his words be theſe;</p>
               <p>Predeſtination <hi>depends not vpon any qualities, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or worke of man: but vpon Gods decree and purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which ſentence is contradictory vnto that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſaith, was condemned as a deſperate Doctrine, by the Doctor: and therefore it is a ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His fourth reaſon I finde, <hi>Appeale, page</hi> 72. &amp;c. it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> is on this wiſe;</p>
               <p>

               <p>I anſwer; this pelting ſtuffe is not worth the view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all the world knowes that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth agree with <hi>Caluin,</hi> in very many things, and it muſt doe ſo, or elſe it muſt agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all the points which <hi>Caluin</hi> reiecteth, which are all the decrees of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> a very few excepted. If I ſhould ſay all the Articles, and the Homilies agree with <hi>Caluin,</hi> for the maine matters of faith, I ſhould ſay no more then what might be proued.

                  <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>doth not teach thus, touching Predeſtination, and why may I not ſay ſo, except you ſhew the contrary, or bring me forth a Creed, a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, a concluſion in being for it, in the Church of</hi> England?</p>
               <p>But let it bee as you will, If this bee all that our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Church hath taught, of Predeſtination, then it hath ſaid nothing of it; for Predeſtination is, <hi>a decree, or diſpoſitiue act of God; will,</hi> as we haue learned by your ſelfe <hi>No</hi> 4.

               <p>If it were true, I would grant him, that, our Church doth not teach, That Predeſtination is without relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to finall grace: but he preſumeth an vntruth.

               <p>Touching the ſecond branch it ſelfe, I anſwer, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> hardly credible, that you did not ſee more then you report: yea, what you did ſee, ſeemes very vncertain: for out of your <hi>Gag. p.</hi> 180. you report <hi>no</hi> 14. the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> touching this point in fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides, it is moſt iniurious, and an imputation moſt falſe: Our Church hath defined Predeſtination, in that 17 article, by all the cauſes whereby it exiſteth, as I haue ſhewed <hi>no</hi> 5. 6. which courſe is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to art, if wee may beleeue, <hi>Thomas 2 dist. 27. q. 1. ar. 2. ad</hi> 9.</p>

               <p>If you could not ſee more in the 17 Article then you profeſſe, to ſee, then you can <hi>ſcumme vpon the ſurface: but not diue into the depth:</hi> then haue you no cauſe to deſpiſe the <hi>capacitie</hi> of other men, <hi>as poore,</hi> nor to vaunt of your owne, as able to <hi>worke wonders:</hi> ſeeing there is more in the Article then you can ſee; as hath beene ſhewed you.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of your reaſons to excuſe your ſelfe, of diſagreeing and diſſenting from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the point of Predeſtination, and for my anſwers thereunto: by which (I hope) all doubts are ſo remoued, that we may conclude,</p>

               <p>I anſwer; he muſt conclude from hence, that,</p>
               <p>Predeſtination muſt not be diſputed.</p>
               <p>Or elſe it is meere <hi>Gaggling.</hi> If he doe thus diſpute then haue wee a worthy diſputation: for wee haue nothing to guide vs but his owne preſident.</p>
               <p>We muſt grant the conſequent: becauſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the antecedent doth inforce it, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too: for who would not loue and hate, what hee loueth and hateth? He ſaith <hi>our predeſtination is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> I commend him for it.

               <p>Hee ſcoffes at them that ſay, the doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is comfortable: belike then to him it is not ſo. But whether of theſe bee in better caſe? whoſe iudgement may we follow, our Churches, or his?</p>

               <p>As the reader may finde plainely laid downe in the former part of this Chap. <hi>no</hi> 3. 4. 14. 15. His choyce was ill, that bringeth falſhood for truth, againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſuch is his condition in this place.</p>
               <p>Now for as much as hee cannot diſcourage you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> by the force of theſe arguments: therefore hee doth ſummon vnto the diſputation, in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt confeſſe my diſſent thorough and ſincere, in no one point, more then in this their Doctrine of Predeſtination,</hi> Appeale, page 60.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; the Dice are now caſt, Caeſar muſt be all or nothing: the combat is offered to all commers; the Gantlet is caſt downe, take it vp who dares. But let him know, he muſt proue his owne Predeſtination,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21007:126"/> or leaue the field. The firſt weapon he appeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is made of this faſhion:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is not the Author of ſinne, or death,</hi> Appeale, page 64.</p>
               <p>This weapon is ſtrengthened with ſome authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Scriptures and Fathers: from that place to page 69.</p>
               <p>But this weapon ſerueth not for this battell. The queſtion is, whether, firſt, God found the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in perdition: ſecondly, whether Predeſtination be with relation vnto finall grace: thirdly, whether Predeſtination doth not appoint to giue grace, for ſo you teach, and theſe we deny. But whether <hi>God be the Author of ſinne and death,</hi> is not thought vpon at this time. Thoſe three you muſt proue, or ſay nothing: for them you haue offered no proofe. It is a ſafe war, where there is no enemy: and a cowardly attempter, that refuſeth the field where the enemie abideth.</p>
               <p>It may be, he will ſay, the refutation of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, doth refute the latter branch of <hi>Caluins</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Predeſtination, propounded, <hi>page</hi> 50. and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>page</hi> 60. becauſe this ſentence followes thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>p.</hi> 54. I anſwer; this helpes not the matter, for the queſtion now on foot,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <hi>whether Gods decree to ſaue</hi> Peter, <hi>be abſolute, and doth proceed from Gods will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> page 53. which is denied by your ſelfe, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as you pretend) the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi> Againſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> and the Synode of <hi>Dort,</hi> p. 38. 53. &amp; 56. There is not a word of that ſecond branch, (which concerneth reprobation) obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, but it is foyſted in by your ſelfe onely, and that vpon good reaſon too; for you knew full well,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21007:127"/> that no man would defend this: but euery man could defend that, againſt you. <hi>It was good policy to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to proue a confeſſed truth:</hi> for ſo you <hi>went with the ſtreame,</hi> and to bee ſilent in the prouing of a manifeſt falſhood, for then you had beene found guilty. You tell vs your reſolution this way, in theſe words;</p>
               <p>I neuer held it wiſedome, to tire my ſelfe with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and tugging vp againſt the ſtreame, when with eaſe enough I might, and with better diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould, ſayle with the flood, <hi>Appeale, p. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, although the caſe had beene as you pretend, yet you had beene abundantly faulty; for diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one branch, when there was two in the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and for oppoſing a conſequent, letting paſſe the antecedent and conſequence: which is (indeed) to deny the concluſion, when you durſt not meddle with the premiſſes.</p>
               <p>Hee keepes the field ſtill, and preſenteth himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> in this manner;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of</hi> Geneua <hi>diſſenteth from the priuate opinions of</hi> Caluin <hi>and</hi> Beza, Appeale, p. 71.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; by <hi>priuate opinion</hi> of <hi>Caluin,</hi> hee muſt meane this of Predeſtination, and from it hee muſt conclude;</p>
               <p>Therefore his Doctrine of Predeſtination is not true.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe he miſſes the preſent buſineſſe. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed, he commeth on the backe, where hee ought to come vnto the face of his enemie: hee ought to proue, that, his Doctrine is true, not diſproue ours; but be it as he will, if you aske him how hee doth know that the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> doth ſo diſſent, hee doth anſwer; <hi>Deodate did tell him ſo.</hi> If you doubt of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21007:127"/> his teſtimony, he tels you, <hi>he is a Miniſter, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in that Church, and ſent to the Synode, from his Country:</hi> well, let him goe for a witneſſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; the chiefeſt doubt is how it may appeare, <hi>Deodate</hi> did ſay ſo: Hee putteth that out of doubt alſo by auouching, <hi>he told him ſo, euen</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> being the man, that <hi>Deodate</hi> was withall at <hi>Eaton;</hi> which proofe cannot be auoided: for hee ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue had the company of <hi>Deodate</hi> in <hi>Eaton,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had beene ſuch a man, whoſe word is as true as ſteele: yet neuertheleſſe his word is of ſmall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for I haue found it deceitfull, <hi>no</hi> 11. 12. therefore I dare not truſt it; but let vs yeeld him, that <hi>Deodate</hi> did tell him ſo: and that therefore our Predeſtination is not true. Then hee muſt be conceiued thus to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;</p>
               <p>Your Doctrine of Predeſtination is not true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine is true.</p>
               <p>A ſubſtantiall diſpute, and well worthy <hi>a rich Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and old learning;</hi> mine is, becauſe yours is not; he telleth vs of ſome that haue <hi>whirligigs in their heads, Appeale, page</hi> 81. I am ſure he is one of them in this argument.</p>
               <p>He ends not with this, but goes on ſtill with theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> words,</p>
               <p>This ſentence: God did decree to glorifie Peter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration had of his faith, &amp;c. is a priuate fancy of ſome particular men; <hi>Appeale, page 58.</hi> neuer heard of, till of late, <hi>page 31.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence he muſt inferre;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore this ſentence, God did decree to glorifie</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c. is not true.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:21007:128"/>
               <p>I anſwer; The Inference is naught, truth in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſtandeth in a conformity vnto the diuine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not vnto the ſooner, or later apprehenſion, and report of men. If you meane, it is not reuealed, then your termes of <hi>Priuate fancy, and yeſterdayes heare-ſay</hi> are but toyes for Children.</p>
               <p>How dare you ſay our doctrine of Predeſtination is a priuate fancie, and a Nouell opinion, ſeeing King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory for learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath expreſly auowed it, in theſe words;</p>
               <p>Predeſtination depends not vpon any qualities or worke of man: but vpon Gods decree and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As I haue ſhewed <hi>no</hi> 12. This teſtimonie doth giue vs ſufficient odds aboue you; for Our ſentence hath royall confirmation, and yours hath none: herewith alſo, I would content my ſelfe, were it not, that he vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, with great vehemency; That,</p>
               <p>This ſentence aboue ſaid, is the doctrine of Nouellizing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Puritans, <hi>Appeale, p. 60.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the remouing hereof, and to giue full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the point; I will adde ſomewhat more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and ſhew, that the doctrine of Predeſtination which we defend, is neither new, nor the inuention of Nouellizing Puritanes. And becauſe I will auoyde all his ſuſpition and imputation of faction and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will alleadge the words and iudgment of other men, not any of mine owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>de grat. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 9. after this ſort: <hi>No reaſon can be aſsigned on our part, of Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination: not onely merits properly ſo called, but alſo the good vſe of freewill, or grace, or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreſeene of God: yea alſo merit of congruity,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21007:128"/> and condition without which, he that is predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhould not be predeſtinated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For explication he ſaith further,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I adde, On our part, becauſe on Gods part, Cauſe may be aſsigned,</hi> viz. <hi>In generall, the declaration of his mercie, and Iuſtice; In particular, God doth not want his reaſon, why hee would predeſtinate vnto life, this man, rather then that, although the ſame be hidden vnto vs.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſentence he vndertaketh to proue, in the tenth chapter following, 1. by Scriptures. 2. by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church. 3. by reaſon founded vpon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Fathers, which hee beginneth thus. <hi>Some out of mankinde are choſen vnto the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. 1. Effectually, ſo as they come thereunto infallibly. 2. Freely, and before all foreſight of works.</hi> This proofe he makes good by the Scriptures in that chapter, By the teſtimony of the Church in the 11. Chapter, namely, by the allegation of many particular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and then in generall he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the Fathers eſteemed of by the Church, euen all of them without exception, did manifeſtly teach this ſentence, after the hereſie of</hi> Pelagius <hi>was begunne. And alſo, it was approued by the publike ſentence of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, he concludeth in theſe words;</p>
               <p>This ſentence ought to be eſteemed, not the opinion of ſome of the learned; but the faith of the Chatholike Church.</p>
               <p>He proues alſo the ſame doctrine of predeſtination by ſeuen reaſons, in the twelfth chapter, euery one of them being no other; but the application, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21007:129"/> of Scripture, vnto the point: and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this ſentence, againſt oppoſition in the 13. 14. and 15 chapters following.</p>
               <p>Theſe teſtimonies of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt bee allowed of by M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> for many reaſons. 1. Becauſe hee is a Ieſuit; and Ieſuites <hi>haue the preeminence for the preſent in the Church of Rome;</hi> as himſelfe informeth <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 203. and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was a <hi>man of better ſpirit then ſome of that ſociety,</hi> as himſelfe auoucheth, <hi>Appeale, pag.</hi> 239. whom he doth there alſo profeſſe to be <hi>ingenious,</hi> and biddeth him, <hi>well to fare.</hi> He doth commend him, and preferre him too, before others, ſaying:</p>
               <p>Bellarmine is a man of as ſtrong a braine, and piercing apprehenſion, as any new vpſtart maſter in Iſrael of the packe, <hi>Appeale, p. 77.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, it may be he will ſay, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is factious in this point.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I will therefore fortifie <hi>Bellarmines</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but not with the teſtimony of any other Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, though I might alleadge <hi>Suarez,</hi> who is not only ſo full in this point as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is, but alſo doth exceed him in the explication and vrging thereof: and that moſt frequently, but I will forbeare that, and only adde the Dominicans; and becauſe I will auoyd needleſſe allegations I will content my ſelfe with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarez,</hi> who in his booke <hi>de Auxiliis diſp. 37. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6. &amp; 9. &amp;c. Diſp. 120 n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 4. ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There can be no cauſe, reaſon, or condition on mans part aſsigned of Predeſtination: but it is to be referred vnto the meere, and vndeſerued will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which, he ſaith further, <hi>is according to the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21007:129"/> of Auguſtine: approued of by many Popes, and taken out of moſt euident teſtimonies of holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The teſtimonie of theſe two, muſt needs be of great force vnto euery man that doth duely conſider them, becauſe, 1. They are our aduerſaries, whoſe teſtimony is of more waight then if they were friends. 2. They are ſuch aduerſaries, as purpoſely doe refuſe to ſpeake as we doe. If then they concurre with vs in words, and the thing it ſelfe, then it is manifeſt, the truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them: for there is nothing elſe to induce them; they want not euaſions (if any were to bee found) for they are men of learning, they haue parts of nature, they are induſtrious themſelues, and are abundantly aſſiſted by others; neither are they ignorant that this their doctrin of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the opinion of <hi>Caluin.</hi> To conclude, this is a ſentence not peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that is, to the ſociety of the Ieſuits, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Dominicans whereof they are, but it is a doctrine vniuerſally receiued, by their learned; as may appeare by <hi>Aluarez</hi> in the 37. diſputation alleadged, and <hi>Suaerez opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 16. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> 7. and that which goes before: onely ſome of them doe differ in the manner of handling it, namely, <hi>whether, both grace and glory, or grace onely, bee thus freely predeſtinated.</hi> Laſtly, it may bee truely eſteemed the faith of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> alſo: becauſe that Councell knew it to bee the iudgement of <hi>Caluine,</hi> whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they meant to reproue in all things they could: yet they decreed not a word againſt it: and it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, they did not forget it, becauſe they ſpent ſo many yeares in that Councell, which is a plaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21007:130"/> they throughly conſidered all the differences betwixt them and <hi>Caluin.</hi> Beſides, in the ſixt Seſſion and twelfth Chapter, it decreeth againſt ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue with themſelues, that <hi>they are certainely in the number of the Predeſtinate;</hi> iudging this to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Caluin,</hi> which is a plaine proofe, that they forgot not <hi>Caluins</hi> opinion in the reſt of his Doctrine touching Predeſtination.</p>
               <p>I hope, this proofe is ſufficient to cleere this point from <hi>nouelty, faction,</hi> &amp;c. termes which it pleaſeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mountagu</hi> to giue it: for what can bee more? Writers (ancient and latter) Churches (of <hi>Rome</hi> and ours) agree in it, confirm &amp; vrge it. If this be <hi>nouelty, faction, puritaniſme, deſperate, deteſtable, and horrible, to the eares of pious men,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> is happy, and his Dutchmen with him, that haue choſen the contrary ſentence: but no reaſonable man will beleeue it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed.</p>
               <p>His next flouriſh is in this ſort, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>

               <p>This diſcourſe may ſerue to diſgrace; but not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue: for hee aſſigneth no imputations, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, nor conſequences, nor antecedents in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. but ſpeaks onely, of ſuch, and onely auowes them vpon his owne affirmation, and vnderſtanding, which are of little worth, for his word is found falſe, <hi>n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

               </p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:21007:130"/>
               <p>Let him bring thoſe particular imputations, thoſe conſequents, which (hee ſaies) are ſo odious, and conſequences which (hee ſaith) are ſo neceſſary, and antecedents, from which they flow; let him ſhew what is imputed, and vnto what, and the world ſhall ſee, he ſpeakes neuer a true word.</p>
               <p>Hee telleth vs of <hi>Rouing, Rowling, Rambling,</hi> I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> might adde, Ruffling, Scuffling, Schambling, Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, Buffling, Brangling, Shifting, Tricking, Shambling, and many more then theſe, if I had Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> his eloquence, and I might put them all, as titles to the diſputations (foregoing) in this point; and yet ſhould I come farre ſhort of the excellency and worthineſſe of his Diſputation, therefore I hope the Reader will iudge as he find s, and ſupply what I want.</p>
               <p>He will ſpeake but once more, and that ſhall driue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> the nayle to the head: thus he ſaith,</p>

               <p>This reaſon muſt be thus framed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If finall perſeuering in obedience, be the appointed inſtrumentall cauſe of mans ſaluation, then finall perſeuering in obedience, &amp;c. is the thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man is of Gods elect.</hi>

               <p>To the parts of the Argument, I anſwer, firſt,</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is denied by our Church, which ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By our deeds wee cannot merit heauen, nor bring vs to the fauour of God, nor winne heauen;</hi> Homilie
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21007:131"/> of Almes-deedes, ſecond part, <hi>page</hi> 326. 327. &amp; 329.</p>
               <p>Vpon this reaſon: becauſe, then,</p>
               <p>A man is a Merchant with God, and ſo defaceth, and obſcureth the price of Chriſts blood.</p>
               <p>Now, our Church hath ouerthrowne his aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there is no need that I ſpeake further thereunto: but yet, that the efficacy of truth taught by our Church, may fully appeare; you ſhall heare himſelfe deny this his owne aſſumption: for thus he writeth;</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>ſaith, Heauen is of workes cauſally, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I differ from him,</hi> Appeale, page 210.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a reward for the righteous, not for workes, or of workes,</hi> Appeale, page 208.</p>
               <p>Some man perhaps will ſay, hee doth then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelfe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; that ſalueth not the wound he giueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his aſſumption, the voyce of truth in his owne mouth againſt himſelfe, is of more worth then many witneſſes. This part of his reaſon being naught, the reſt hath no force to inferre the concluſion; yet I proceed to the reſt.</p>
               <p>The foreſaid argument (at the beſt) (and amongſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> his beſt friends) is not worthy anſwering. It is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the dry bones of a Hackney ridden to death, many yeares paſt. I finde it propounded and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by <hi>Bellarmine, de grat. lib. 2. cap. 13.

               </p>
               <p>To the conſequence of the propoſition, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is moſt feeble and falſe.</p>
               <p>A man may haue euerlaſting life in the euent, by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21007:132"/> reaſon of his finall perſeuering: and yet not be decreed thereunto, by reaſon of his finall perſeuerance foreſeene.</p>
               <p>I ſhew it out of the ſaid Authors, thus:</p>
               <p>

               <p>This diſtinction I finde in <hi>Bellarmine, de gratia, lib. 2. cap. 14. Reſpondeo illud.</hi> In <hi>Suarez, opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 18. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4. De deo part 2. lib. 1. cap. 14. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  </hi> 19.</p>
               <p>If any doubt of the truth of this diſtinction, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors alleadged doe bring proofe enough for it; and chiefly <hi>Suarez</hi> in the places alleadged, &amp; in his <hi>opuſc. 1. lib. 3. cap. 19. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4. &amp;c.</hi> to whom I referre the Reader.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing then that the diſtinction is without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I anſwer; Gods action of execution, wrought in time, doth indeed repreſent Gods eternall will of execution: for the will of execution, is no more, but a diſpoſition of execution, or the execution it ſelfe preconceiued in the minde of God, as the Authors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged doe truely ſpeake.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſaith truely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So ſaued, are So ordained by God. Whatſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, commeth So to paſſe, becauſe God hath ſayd,</hi> So, and no otherwiſe it ſhall come to paſſe, <hi>Gagge, page</hi> 177.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The one is originall of the other, and the one is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the other,</hi> Appeale, page. 61.</p>
               <p>But this is not to our purpoſe, for we ſpeake not of Predeſtination, as it containes Gods will of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but of intention.</p>
               <p>The acts of God done in time, doe not repreſent
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21007:132"/> Gods eternall will of intenſion; which is no more, but a decree appointing, that the thing ſhall bee. The will of intention medleth not with the manner how the meanes ſhall produce the effect, and how the effect ſhall flow from the meanes, it aſſigneth not which is the meanes, which the end, as the ſaid authors haue abundantly proued.</p>
               <p>It is the firſt act of Gods will, touching mans ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is not regulated by any former. God was wholly free to will it, or not to will it, to will it vnto this man, or vnto another, there being nothing in the creature to reſtraine this liberty, and determine the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will vnto one: ſo that you muſt ſhew vs diuine reuelation, that affirmeth the <hi>finall perſeuerance of</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>was the reaſon to moue God, to appoint him vnto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It is not an infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made from an act of temporall execution, that can be a ſufficient ground to inioine vs to beleeue it: but ſuch reuelation there is none, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude, <hi>there was no ſuch reaſon, leading God to predeſtinate this or that man vnto glory.</hi> Here, I may enquire of M. <hi>Mountagu</hi> whether he hath read this anſwer, &amp; others like vnto it or not: (one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is certainly true.) If he hath not read it, where is his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent reading he ſo much doth vant of? where is that diuine that ſo often calleth others <hi>ignorant, poore, and ſcummers vpon the ſurface;</hi> and ſuch like termes Now theſe poore diuines, theſe <hi>ſimple ignaroes,</hi> muſt <hi>giberiſh</hi> to him, <hi>he knowes not what.</hi> If hee hath read them, where was his conſcience, when he vrged an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſo often anſwered, and ſo much oppoſed? and (which is more) when he tendered it barely as a thing granted, without (ſo much as) one word out of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21007:133"/> the diuine reuelation to confirme it, or to take away thoſe anſwers which are made to it? What will he plead? Is <hi>Suarez, Aluarez,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſome of his <hi>poore Diuines, meere Gaglers, Blunderers, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, &amp;c.</hi> not worth the anſwering, not worth the regarding, the naming? If his will bee, to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ridiculous, he may thus anſwer: and (to ſay the very truth) his deeds doe thus anſwer, though wee haue not his words for it. I might goe on with this inquirie; but I content my ſelfe with this, leauing it to the iudgement of the vnderſtanding reader.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I applyed the anſwers of theſe authors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the argument, which doth abundantly, ſhew the weakneſſe thereof: and I might content my ſelfe with that: but I will adde ſomewhat more which the argument it ſelfe doth lead vnto.</p>
               <p>This argument ſet downe <hi>no</hi> 27. ſpeaketh of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> and if it were a decree to giue glory onely, and thereby it doth beg the queſtion; becauſe, that is denyed him, by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ours. If he ſay, he takes <hi>Predeſtination to be a decree to giue grace alſo,</hi> then this argument muſt be framed thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finall perſeuering in obedience is the inſtumentall cauſe, that</hi> Peter <hi>receiued grace in the euent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore without finall perſeuering in obedience, God did not appoint by Predeſtination to giue</hi> Peter <hi>grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The antecedent or firſt part is denyed by all which liue in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea, euen by them, that would haue <hi>Predeſtination to glory</hi> to bee vpon the foreſight of workes; and they muſt ſo deny, becauſe the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 6.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:21007:133"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preuenting grace is giuen by God, man hauing no merits,</hi> cap. 5. <hi>Wee are iuſtified freely, becauſe none of thoſe things which precede Iuſtification (whether faith, or workes) doe merit iuſtifying grace it ſelfe,</hi> cap. 8.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing touching the free giuing of the firſt Grace, wee learne from our owne Church, which taketh it from S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and tendreth it vnto vs, in the Sermon of Faſting, <hi>p.</hi> 172. In theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man doth good workes, to receiue grace by his good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good workes doe not bring forth grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace belongeth to God, who doth call vs, and then hath he good workes, whoſoeuer receiueth grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which ſentence is ſo full and plaine, and of ſuch authority, that I ſhall not need to ſay any more, to ſhew the inſufficiency of the Argument: therefore here, I will end my anſwer therunto, which alſo muſt put an end to our Diſputation, touching this point of Predeſtination, becauſe he doth not offer any further occaſion.</p>
               <p>By that which is paſt, it doth appeare, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this point of Predeſtination; and that hee hath nothing (of any worth) to ſay for himſelfe, or againſt our Church.</p>
               <p>Now wee ſhould diſcouer, with whom hee doth conſent in the point: for with ſome he doth conſent; elſe it is a <hi>priuate fancy,</hi> peculiar to himſelfe. With the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> he doth not conſent. I take that as certaine: therefore he muſt conſent with the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> I name them both, becauſe both haue ſhares in the buſineſſe. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> doe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21007:134"/> vrge this doctrine of Predeſtination, but not very ſtrictly; nor as a matter vndoubtedly revealed: nor doe they preſſe it in all the particulars brought by M. <hi>Mountagu:</hi> and therefore it muſt bee aſcribed to <hi>Arminius</hi> (by vs) becauſe hee is the man, whoſe voyce was neareſt vnto vs; hee vrged it with more particulars, and vpon greater neceſſitie, then the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> doe: he choſe rather to ſee the Country that bred him, brought him vp, and aduanced him, come to vtter ruine, rather then hee would hold his peace, or retract this ſentence of Predeſtination. I forbeare to confirme this by the particular paſſages written by <hi>Arminius, Vorſtius,</hi> and other of that ſide; becauſe it would be tedious, and without all benefit. What hath paſſed, is ſufficient to ſhew, hee teacheth falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and vntruth. Therefore here I will end the whole Diſputation.</p>
               <p>There be alſo other points of Faith, in his two Bookes, which oppoſe the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and which deſerue a reproofe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are propounded and handled by him in the firſt place, and their oppoſition is moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, therefore haue I contented my ſelfe with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of theſe onely, reſeruing the reſt till ſome other opportunity.</p>

               <p>Appeale, pag. 320.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; It is no meruaile, though you ſet your whole ſtrength, to remoue the ſuſpicion of danger, from the points you haue deliuered; yea it would be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21007:139"/> much meruaile, to ſee you doe otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for hee that layeth a ſnare, muſt conceale it, leaſt his purpoſe be fruſtrated; but your labour is ſpent in vaine, a weake ſight may ſee them full of danger.</p>
               <p>That they are dangerous to our eternall eſtate, and of themſelues, fitted to bring ſad euents, is manifeſt; for all of them are articles of erronious faith. Now an erronious faith is an addition vnto the diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, threatned by God, to bee puniſhed eternally, <hi>Reuel. 22. &amp;</hi> 18. verſe, Some of them bee articles of the erronious faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they bee dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vnto our ſaluation, wee haue the teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> who ſaith expreſly, That, <hi>they are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to kindle Gods wrath, and condemne our ſoules for euer, Apol. part. 6. c. 22. diuid.</hi> 1. And <hi>c. 20. diuid.</hi> 2. he ſaith, <hi>vnleſſe we leaue them, we cannot come to Chriſt:</hi> With whom agreeth our reuerend Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi> in his directions to know the true Church, <hi>p. 63. &amp;</hi> 64. For of the Romiſh faith he ſaith, That it is <hi>traps and ſnares, dangerous, and tending to mans deſtruction.</hi> Your ſelfe doe no leſſe, when you ſay, <hi>Popery is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of ſuperſtition, enemie vnto pietie,</hi> Appeale, p. 321.</p>
               <p>The particular points, whereof wee haue diſputed, doe ſay no leſſe.</p>
               <p>For, if wee muſt take our faith in all matters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of doubt, from the ſentence of a Councell, then can we haue therein no diuine faith; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ſaluation.</p>
               <p>If a man beleeue, that a ſinner is iuſtified (from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> actuall ſinne which he hath committed) by a created being, that remaineth ſetled, and ſeated in him, then he beleeueth, that, thereby thoſe ſinnes are ſo done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that no being thereof remaineth, and that all the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21007:140"/> powers, and faculties of man, are diſpoſed, and fitted, vnto obedience as amply and largely as the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth, and preſcribeth obedience, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is in danger of damnation: for ſuch a man reſteth in his owne Iuſtice, to keepe him from hell, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to heauen; and thereby truſteth vnto a ſliding foot, and a broken tooth, for aſmuch as God hath laid out the way vnto them in another line.</p>
               <p>Hee that beleeueth that the continuance of grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> (whereby man is fitted vnto holineſſe in this life, and happineſſe in the life to come, by Gods appointment) is ſo contingent, and vncertaine, that euery man that hath it, may be, and ſome men are, depriued thereof, and left in the ſtate wherein hee was firſt borne, and wholly deſtitute of all inward fitneſſe to holineſſe and happineſſe; he is in danger of damnation: for, ſuch a one beleeueth, that ſome men at this inſtant, are in the way to heauen, and holineſſe, beautifull, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the eyes of God: but in a moment, ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and hatefull vnto God, and in themſelues tending vnto nothing, but wickedneſſe, and damnation: and conſequently is or may bee in this condition, of, in, and out, euery moment, and inſtant of his life: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he beleeueth that all men may, and ſome men doe, retaine their ſanctitie, in their inward diſpoſition, and outward actions for many yeares, but in the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their life, are depriued thereof, and are caſt into hell. Which faith can in no ſort agree vnto the ioy and conſolation of heart, which the ſanctified doe enioy: Nor vnto that loue of God, and the righteouſneſſe of his Kingdome, which euery ſuch a man doth find by experience: Nor vnto that great loue, and delight, which God beareth vnto, and taketh
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21007:140"/> in his Saints; ſo largely expreſſed in the Scriptures: Nor vnto the diuine prouidence which gouerneth the world with infinite wiſdome.</p>
               <p>He that beleeueth Images are profitable to the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> vp of deuotion, and may bee had in Churches, and imployed for that vſe, is in danger of damnation: for ſuch a man will not ceaſe till he hath them, and ſo imploy them, and thereby is in danger of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, through their fitneſſe, and mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and hee that doth worſhip them, doth commit idolatry, and idolatry is puniſhable with damnation. He that beleeueth honour is due to Images, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that in giuing honour vnto them, hee doth an action ſupernaturall, acceptable to God, and that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to heauen; ſeeing that, no honour can be due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but by Gods reuealed appointment: and conſequently he is in danger of damnation: becauſe ſuch a man indeuoureth to ſerue God, and to come to heauen, by an obedience deuiſed by himſelfe: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God hath not appointed any honour to bee giuen to Images.</p>
               <p>Hee that beleeueth, that Chriſt is really, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> preſent in the Sacrament, will honour the Sacrament, with honour due to God: which (that I may ſpeake in the words of Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> in his Reply, the 8. Article, p. 283.) <hi>cannot bee attempted without great danger: for it is Idolatry: ſeeing Chriſt is not there really and ſubſtantially:</hi> and all <hi>Idolaters ſhall haue their portion in the ſecond death,</hi> Reuel. 21. verſe 8.</p>
               <p>Hee that beleeueth, hee aſſenteth vnto God that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> calleth, and exciteth, freely: ſo as, hee can reiect and diſſent from that calling and excitation (if hee will) is in danger of damnation: for ſuch a one beleeueth,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21007:141"/> that he ſo conſenteth out of the liberty and dominion, that his will hath to doe, or not to doe, to conſent, or diſſent, and not yeeld that conſent in obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any preuiall worke, and true efficiency of grace, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him thereunto: and conſequently, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth firſt and originally make the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene himſelfe and another, that diſſenteth from that grace of God that calleth: and that he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſomething which he hath not receiued, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may boaſt, contrary to the word of God, that ſaith,</p>
               <p>Who hath made thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou that thou diddeſt not receiue? Now if thou diddeſt receiue it, why doſt thou glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if thou hadſt not receiued it? <hi>1 Cor. 4. and 7. verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the like deduction, the danger of your Doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> of Predeſtination will appeare, which is no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the place of the Apoſtle now alleadged, then the point of Free-will: for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in termes, that comprehend Gods purpoſe, or decree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, as well as actions wrought in time.</p>
               <p>I might ſhew the like danger, to ariſe from the reſt of the points deliuered by you, and vrge the danger of theſe other waies: but I thinke this ſufficient, to make it apparent, that they are dangerous vnto a mans ſoule.</p>
               <p>Touching the danger which (of themſelues) they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> are apt to breed, vnto our outward eſtate, I ſhall need to ſay little; becauſe what you ſay of your ſelfe, <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, page</hi> 42. I ſay for my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am loath to touch here, or to meddle beyond my ſlipper, the State is not the ſubiect of my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21007:141"/> I pray for the proſperity of Prince, and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: but let their courſes alone to whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, I hope I may with licenſe, and good leaue, alleadge what is manifeſt to all men, and deliuered by your ſelfe. Thus you write;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popery is for tyranny,</hi> Appeale, p. 321.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſay I, with the generall conſent of all thoſe that know Popery, and are not ſubiect thereunto. By tyranny, you meane, tyranny ouer Kingdomes: for you oppoſe it (in the place alleadged) vnto <hi>Anarchie,</hi> now (I hope) euery man will ſay, Tyranny is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious euill to any State or Kingdome. If you had not ſaid thus, the thing it ſelfe would haue ſaid it for you: <hi>for Tyranny is, where one man doth rule the whole, by an vnbrideled and vnlimited will and pleaſure.</hi> Now this the Pope claimeth ouer all Kingdomes, whoſe will is accounted a law, to whom no man may ſay, This is not well done: nor call his actions into queſtion.</p>
               <p>If you ſay you haue not taught this, therefore <hi>your</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21007:142"/> ouer Councels, hath bred, and confirmed this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his, ouer temporall States, and Kingdomes; as he that readeth <hi>Bellarmine, de Rom.

               <p>If wee receiue theſe points of Popery hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> then muſt we receiue all the reſt of the Popiſh faith, for theſe are no truer then they; nor are theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by any, which doth not receiue them.

                  <hi>The learnedeſt, the moſt conformable, the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rewarded, &amp;c. yea the faith it ſelfe, of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is for Popery. Therefore Popery is the true faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then euery man will be ready to embrace the faith of <hi>Rome,</hi> and good reaſon too, ſeeing this teſtimony wanteth nothing to giue it authority; the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, a friend, (nay more) <hi>a Brother that hath beene borne, bred, and brought vp in the confeſsion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that hath learned, loued, admired, and propoſed to himſelfe to follow indeclinable, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline of the Church of</hi> England, Appeale, page 111. <hi>No new vp-ſtart Maſter in Iſrael. But one that adhereth and conſenteth vnto, the Apoſtles, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21007:143"/> their true ſucceſſors, immediate and mediate,</hi> Appeale, page 45. and 46. <hi>The Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>is propoſed in Synods, confirmed by law, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament,</hi> Appeale, page 111.</p>
               <p>As the qualitie of your perſon, &amp; pretence, ſo your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> outward condition in our State and Church, doe ſerue very fitly, to bring in Popery; <hi>for you are knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and approued by his ſacred Maieſty,</hi> King Iames; as you doe ſolemnly informe vs in the Preface to your Appeale, and in the Booke it ſelfe. <hi>page 43. You are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto, and fauoured by, men of principall ranke, in the gouernement of our Church and common-wealth:</hi> as wee learne from your Epiſtle, ſet before your Treatiſe of the Inuocation of Saints, neere to the end thereof. You are indeed rewarded with preferments, many for number, great for value. Who would deny his conſent vnto Popery, when it is brought by a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger thus accompliſhed? You are a Miniſter and a Preacher, therefore when you bring in Popery, <hi>you goe compendiouſly to worke; for you are like enough to gaine, and draw your Pariſhioners with you, at leaſt to make them more feaſable then other waies they would be:</hi> as yourſelfe writes in the third page of your Preface to the Reader, ſet before your Gagge. You are a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher vnto many congregations, therefore you muſt needes draw the more people after you; and they draw others; for we ſee by experience, things new and ſtrange, ſtay not alwaies with them that receiue them firſt. Moreouer, <hi>by Preaching Popery,</hi> they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated according vnto the diſpoſition of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men; hee that is inclinable thereunto, may bee
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21007:144"/> 
                  <hi>followed ſeriouſly, plied at all times. He that is auerſe may bee obſerued, and delt withall as opportunity is offered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, preaching is of greateſt efficacie, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnder the name of Gods ordinance, it is more fit to enter into, and preuaile vpon, the thoughts of man, than any other courſe: like as the ſmall raine reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth vpon, entreth into, and ſofteneth the earth, more then the great and haſtie ſhowers. By preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing popery may be let in ſoftly, without noiſe, ſlowly without violence, like as liquid bodies are diſtilled by a ſoft fire, &amp; being once entred, taketh faſter hold like vnto a ſcrew, that is not heard when it entreth, nor can be pulled out when it hath taken hold.</p>
               <p>This courſe, to bring in popery was now requiſite: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> for all violence was in vaine, no attempt that way could preuaile, it made vs more warie, and reſolued againſt it: like the boiſterous winde, that cauſeth a man to lay faſter hold vpon his clothes, to keepe them about him. What diſputations haue they had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt vs, for continuance, &amp; multitude of years: for learning and ſubtlety? What deuices haue they vſed to keepe ours from them, to conuey theirs vnto vs? Cunning counſells to grace it, deſperate <hi>Ianizaries</hi> to conuey it into euery Kingdome, Prouince, diuiſion, familie, houſhold, ſingular perſon, if it were poſſible? What wars and trecherie haue they omitted, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of <hi>Wicklife, Hus, Ziska, Henry</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (beſides many others) will ſhew. More of any of theſe are not needfull, nor can be expected; yet what haue they gotten, haue they won a party vnto their faith, or one man to beleeue as they doe? Surely this they haue gained, enen a <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21007:144"/> dyed red in the blood of the Saints, and a name, but not of the ſonnes of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who neuer had the glory of hereſie, and poiſon of falſe doctrine, cruelty, trechery, murder, vſurpation.</hi> Now, now therefore, is the time when you muſt change your copie, turne ouer a new leafe; bethinke your ſelfe of a new courſe; turne your threatnings into flatterings; your loud ſound into ſtill voices; your long diſputations, into diſtilled drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, your enmity into pretended friendſhip, your conioyned armies into ſeuered corner creepers; your armour into Gownes; your ſwords into ſithes, your bills into mattocks: Finally, let no voice of warre be heard in your ſtreets: Sound, and reſound; lift vp like a trumpet the voice of Peace, tune your inſtruments, to make that harmony to bee more delightfull, then the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and then perhaps you may gaine him vnto your ſide, whom God hath giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to <hi>beleeue lyes:</hi> but for the reſt, they will, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſhall, haue iuſt cauſe to ſay, as we now doe, <hi>The ſnare is broken we are eſcaped, thanks be vnto God.</hi>

               <p>I might giue ſatisfaction to euery one of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular railings, for there is ſufficient for it: but I will not burthen the reader ſo much. This that I haue ſaid, is ſufficient: becauſe theſe things being thus, none of his other bitter invectiues can bee true. Though they were true, yet doe they make either wholly againſt him, or nothing at all for him.</p>
               <p>I conclude this whole diſcourſe, in the words wherein Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> concluded his, to Maſter <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> pag. 652.</p>
